Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Breath partial

By means of this spell, the caster causes plants to spring up from the ground and entangle all creatures in the area of effect. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in the area, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Those held receive a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Creatures that make a save vs. breath temporarily avoid entanglement and can move at half their normal movement rate through the area, but must make an additional saving throw each round that they remain in the area of effect. An entangled creature can attack, provided it does not have to move to reach an opponent. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large and strong creatures who suffer little to no distress from the entangling plants.~

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 turns

Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1

Level: 1
School: Abjuration
Sphere: Charm, Protection
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all opponents to ignore their existence, as if they were invisible. While protected by this spell, the priest cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells focused on themselves or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal their wounds, for example, or to cast a Chant spell, but they cannot cast spells on other targets without ending the spell.~

Level: 1
School: Alteration
Sphere: Combat, Plant
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to create a magical cudgel. Dealing 2D4 + 1 crushing damage upon a successful hit, this shillelagh also causes tendrils to wrap around and hold the victim in place for 1 round unless they successfully make a save vs. breath. The caster wields the shillelagh as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and it is considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit. This enchantment level increases by one for every four extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 9th level. Strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the shillelagh are considered to be melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The shillelagh can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.~

Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all enemies within the area of effect, making their position and movements easily visible. Invisible creatures are revealed, and those who do not successfully make a saving throw vs. spell are distinctly outlined for the next 5 rounds. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by stealth, invisibility, or similar effects, and suffer a -2 penalty to AC. The faerie fire light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light, and does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.~

@27=~Strength of Stone~
@28=~Strength of Stone
Level: 1
School: Alteration
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Calling upon the strength of the earth, the caster gains some of the solidity and strength of stone, setting their strength to 18 and adding an additional +50 exceptional strength on top of this, and they receive any Strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 Strength, then their Strength will just be set to 18/00, while if a character has a Strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then their Strength will become 18/50 + the original percentage. If their Strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's Strength if it is already 19 or more. For the duration of the spell, the caster also becomes immune to everything, magical or otherwise, that pushes them away, such as wing buffets, telekinesis, Gust of Wind, and Battering Ram.~

Range: Long
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 person or animal
Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell affects any single person or animal that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. If the target fails their save vs. spell, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.

Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a Find Traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to them. Once per round, all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can create a sudden or unexpected result, the caster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus, "traps" include glyphs and similar spells and devices.~

@41=~Flame Blade~

Range: Personal
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from their hand, dealing 2D6 + 1 fire damage upon a successful hit. The caster wields this blade-like ray as if proficient with the weapon and at their normal base THAC0, and it is considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit. This enchantment level increases by one for every three extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 9th level. Since the blade is immaterial, Strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the flame blade are considered to be melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The flame blade can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.~

The undead cannot be held with this spell.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

The caster wields the spiritual hammer as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and it functions as a magical weapon with an enchantment bonus of +1 (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses). Starting at level 5, this enchantment level increases by one for every five extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +5 at 25th level. Due to its ethereal nature, Strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the spiritual weapon are considered to be melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0).

When the spell is cast, the druid weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the trap, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The trap deals 1D4 fire damage per experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. breath will receive only half damage.

Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 360' radius
Saving Throw: Breath half

Immediately upon completion of the spell and once per round thereafter, the caster causes a 30 foot-long vertical bolt of lightning to come crashing down upon an enemy. The spell calls forth one lightning bolt for every three experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5 lightning bolts at 15th level. The lightning will strike first at the target of the spell, dealing 6D6 electrical damage. Those who make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty will receive only half damage. For the remainder of the storm's duration, the bolts will strike out randomly at the enemies of the caster.~

@75=~Dispel Magic~
@76=~Dispel Magic
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Sphere: All
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Special

Dispel Magic dispels the magical effects upon any creatures within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experience level of the caster and the experience level of the caster whose magic is being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the caster whose magic they are trying to dispel, their chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the caster whose magic they are attempting to dispel, their chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.~

@78=~Glyph of Warding
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Short
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Breath half

A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any enemy violating the warded area will trigger the trap.

When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The glyph deals 1D4 electrical damage per experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. breath will receive only half damage. This spell will not harm party members.~

School: Enchantment
Sphere: Animal
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell holds persons and animals rigidly immobile and in place. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. The effect is centered on the target selected by the caster, and every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Creatures who make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Upon casting this spell, the caster is able to free a victim from enchantments and curses. The spell can reverse the effects of confusion, deafness, feeblemindedness, hold, petrification, and silence, free a victim from magical fear, sleep, and charm, and break the effects of a curse. Note that Break Enchantment cannot remove the curse from a shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, but allows those affected with any such cursed item to be free of it. Certain special curses may not be counterable by this spell, or may be counterable only by a caster of a certain level or only through a particular ritual.~

Saving Throw: Spell negates

Miscast Magic causes spells cast by the affected creature to take on an effect different from what they intend, similar to what happens during a wild surge. There is a chance that the result will be beneficial to the caster, but generally, the effects are undesirable. The target must make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty to avoid their spells being miscast for the duration of the spell.~

Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell causes confusion to the target, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The victim must save vs. spell or either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures tend to move as far from the caster as possible, but any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to their basic nature. The target has a saving throw penalty of -2, and there is an additional -1 for every extra two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level.~

By laying their hands upon a sickly person, the caster can cure almost any disease, including blindness and deafness, with this spell.

The Summon Insects spell attracts a cloud of insects to attack one target. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster, and attacks the creature the caster points to.

For the duration of the spell, the target fights with a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Every round, the target must also make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty or suffer 100% chance of spell failure and 4D2 piercing damage from insect bites.

Saving Throw: Polymorph negates

The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental characteristics are not affected and they do not receive any special abilities for their new form, but physical characteristics are changed to adhere to their new form and they lose any special abilities they had in their original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the target into a squirrel unless they make a save vs. polymorph. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with 1-5 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -4 penalty, those with 6-10 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -2 penalty, those with 11-15 HD/levels or more make their saving throw with no penalty, and those who with more than 15 HD/levels make their saving throw at a +2 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent, or until dispelled.

Note that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once they die or the effects are dispelled.~

It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area of effect attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of dealing some type of elemental damage will still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked.

Furhermore, creatures in the area of effect continue to burn after the initial blast, suffering an additional 1D6 fire damage every round for 1 turn. Those who make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty receive only half damage and avoid the afterburn. The gem can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell or until used. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

This powerful abjuration spell causes spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 99 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Priests are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity.

Saving Throw: Spell negates

When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation. The caster becomes the very ideal of beauty - for a male, this is usually a nymph or a dryad, while for a female, the image varies. The transformation is instantaneous, but lasts only seconds, and any person (excluding party members) viewing the illusion must save vs. spell at a -4 penalty or be charmed for 1 turn. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the affected creatures fail their saving throws, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creatures will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster attempts to harm a charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creatures resume their previous behavior prior to being charmed.~

When this spell is cast, it causes a ray of sunlight to beam down upon the caster and a globe of searing radiance to explode in a 30 foot radius. All hostile creatures in the area of effect are blinded for 1 turn. Living creatures suffer 10D6 fire damage, while undead creatures caught within the sunburst instead suffer 1D6 fire damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 20D6 at 20th level. A successful save vs. breath at a -4 penalty negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half. The burst also results in the destruction of all undead creatures specifically averse to bright light (such as vampires, shadows, and wraiths) that fail a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty.

This spell removes most temporary and permanent negative effects from the target creature. It reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature caused by any force, spell, or monster. It can restore a polymorphed or petrified creature to its natural form, break the effects of a curse, reverse unnatural mental states such as confusion, feeblemindedness, and berserk rages, and free the recipient from magical effects like fear, paralysis, sleep, and stun. This potent spell will also restore any lost hit points, cure the target of any diseases or poisons, and attempt to restore any drained statistics.

The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, leaving them physically and mentally exhausted. For 5 rounds after the spell is cast, the priest will suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, AC, and casting speed.~

For the duration of the spell, the affected creatures fight with a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Every round, they must also make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty or suffer 100% chance of spell failure and 8D2 piercing damage from insect bites. A successful saving throw allows those affected to avoid most of the swarm and receive only half damage while completely negating the spell failure.

When this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips through the ground. There are a total of three tremors that are caused by the earthquake, which are staggered and occur once per round starting immediately upon the completion of the spell. The eartquake affects everyone (except earth elementals and flying creatures) in the area of affect, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The first tremor causes all creatures to fall to the ground for 2 rounds and suffer 6D6 crushing damage, but those who successfully save vs. death at a -6 penalty will receive only half damage and avoid falling down. The second tremor is less severe than the first, but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth. Creatures in the area of effect suffer 4D6 crushing damage (a successful save vs. death at a -4 penalty reduces it by half), and they also have a 25% chance of stepping and falling into a fissure, and must successfully make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty or die. The final tremor is the least severe of the three, and creatures suffer 2D6 crushing damage (a successful save vs. death at a -2 penalty reduces it by half). During this final tremor, there is also a 10% chance of falling and becoming trapped within a fissure, and creatures must save vs. breath at a -2 penalty or die. Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.~

Saving Throw: Spell partial

This spell causes a 2 foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly towards its target, dealing magic damage and causing different effects depending upon its color. As the level of the caster improves, both the damage dealt and number of colors known increases. The color of any given orb is chosen randomly from the colors known at the mage's level, and the orb is occasionally even multicolored, causing multiple effects. The target cannot avoid the initial damage, but can save vs. spell to negate the secondary effects.
