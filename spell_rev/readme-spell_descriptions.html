<h2>Level 1 Spells</h2>

<br>Sphere: All
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon this this spell, the priest grants a +1 bonus to THAC0, damage, and morale to friendly creatures. The caster determines at what range they will cast the spell, and the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Command</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Charm, Combat, Law
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 round
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell enables the priest to command another creature to lie down and take no action (sleep) for a single round. The target has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level.
<br>
<br><strong>Cure Light Wounds</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Sphere: Healing
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: Permanent
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When casting this spell and laying their hand upon a creature, the priest heals the wounds and injuries of the target. The priest can restore 10 + 1/two levels hit points, up to a maximum of 20 at 20th level. //This healing cannot affect creatures of incorporeal or extraplanar origin.
<br>
<br><strong>Detect Alignment</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Divination
<br>Sphere: Divination
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell allows the priest to search out the feelings of all creatures within the current area. When affected by this spell, a target will briefly glow red if they're evil, green if they're good, and white if they're neutral. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Entangle</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Plant
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster causes plants to spring up from the ground and entangle all creatures in the area of effect. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in the area, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Those held receive a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Creatures that make a save vs. breath temporarily avoid entanglement and can move at half speed through the area, but must make an additional saving throw every round they remain in the area of effect. An entangled creature can attack, provided it does not have to move to reach an opponent. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large and strong creatures who suffer little to no distress from the entangling plants.
<br>
<br><strong>Magical Stone</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Combat
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant ten small stones, no larger than sling bullets. When thrown, each stone deals 1D4 + 2 missile damage (1D4 + 5 against undead) upon a successful hit, and the character can hurl up to three stones per round. The caster wields them as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and they are considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what they can hit. The stones can be used only by the caster, and remain in their hand for the duration of the spell or until used.
<br>
<br><strong>Protection from Evil</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Protection
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: first, all attacks made by evil creatures against the protected creature receive a -2 penalty to their THAC0, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Resist Fear</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Charm
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The priest instills courage in allies, raising their morale to its highest. If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated, and they are protected from it for the duration of the spell. The instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Sanctuary</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Charm, Protection
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all opponents to ignore their existence, as if they were invisible. While protected by this spell, the priest cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells focused on themselves or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal their wounds, for example, or to cast a Chant spell, but they cannot cast spells on other targets without ending the spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Shillelagh</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Combat, Plant
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell enables the caster to create a magical cudgel. Dealing 2D4 + 1 crushing damage upon a successful hit, this shillelagh also causes tendrils to wrap around and hold the victim in place for one round unless a save vs. breath is made. The caster wields the shillelagh as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and it is considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit. This enchantment level increases by one for every four extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 9th level. The shillelagh can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Armor of Faith</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Protection
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The caster of this spell receives significant protection against physical and magic damage. This magical armor is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster, effectively reducing damage sustained by 10%. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Doom</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Charm
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell causes a feeling of doom to overwhelm the target. For the duration of the spell, the target suffers a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, and saving throws. The creature may make a save vs. spell at a penalty of -1 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Sunscorch</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Sphere: Sun
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a brilliant ray of scorching heat slants down from the sky and strikes a creature chosen by the caster. The target struck by the ray is blinded for 1 round and suffers 2D6 fire damage as well an additional 1D6 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 6D6 at 9th level. The target may make a save vs. breath to avoid being blinded and receive only half damage. Undead creatures and other monsters vulnerable to bright light suffer double damage. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Strength of Stone</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Calling upon the strength of the earth, the caster gains some of the solidity and strength of stone. This spell sets the strength of the character to 18 and gives an additional +50 exceptional strength, and the character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then their strength will just be set to 18/00, while if a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then their strength will become 18/50 + the original percentage. If their strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more. For the duration of the spell, the caster also becomes immune to everything, magical or otherwise, that pushes them away, such as wing buffets, telekinesis, Gust of Wind, and Battering Ram.
<br>
<br><strong>Faerie Fire</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Sphere: Weather
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 5' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all enemies within the area of effect, making their position and movements easily visible. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, invisibility, or similar effects, and suffer a -2 penalty to AC. Those who make a save vs. spell are totally unaffected by the spell. The faerie fire light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light, and does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Regenerate Light Wounds</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Healing
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell enables the caster to mend the wounds and injuries of the target by granting them temporary regeneration. The affected creature will regenerate 15 + 1.5/two levels hit points over the duration of the spell, up to a maximum of 30 at 20th level.
<br>
<br><strong>Goodberry</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Plant
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Casting a Goodberry spell creates 5 magical berries that the caster can carry with them or give to others. When consumed, these berries restore 1 hit point and an additional hit point for every four extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5 at 17th level. The berries last for 24 hours or until eaten.
<br>
<br><strong>Cause Light Wounds</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Sphere: Necromantic
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell is the reverse of Cure Light Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes injuries. On a successful touch from the priest, the target suffers 1D10 + 1/two levels magic damage, up to a maximum of 1D10 + 10 at 20th level. The spell expires once the priest makes a successful melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0) or after 1 turn has passed. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Animal Summoning I</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Sphere: Animal
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster calls a number of animals that serve the summoner. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the druid casting the spell. The summoned animals will aid the caster under any condition and by whatever means they possess, staying until the spell duration expires.
<br>
<br>1st: 3 bats

<br> Diseasing: target suffers a -1 penalty to dexterity and constitution for 8 hours (save vs. death neg.)
<br> Swarm: each bat within 10' receives a +2 bonus to THAC0

<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Sphere: Weather

<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a misty bank of fog billows out from the designated point, obscuring all sight. Everyone within the cloud suffers a -2 penalty to THAC0 while their visibility range is reduced by half, and anyone inside or outside the cloud trying to attack a creature concealed by the fog with ranged weapons will do so with a -4 penalty to THAC0. Creatures that do not rely on sight can fight within the cloud without penalties.


<br><br><h2><a id="divine2"></a>Level 2 Spells</h2>

<br><strong>Aid</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Sphere: Combat, Necromantic
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 1 turn/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The recipient of this spell gains a +1 bonus to THAC0, damage, and saving throws. They also gain 5 + 1/level temporary hit points, up to a maximum of 15 at 10th level. This spell allows the recipient to temporarily have more hit points than their full normal total, and these bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Barkskin</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Plant
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a druid casts the Barkskin spell upon a creature, their skin becomes as tough as bark, giving them a +2 bonus to AC that increases by 1 for every six extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +4 at 15th level. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Chant</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Sphere: Combat
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon themselves and their party while causing harm to their enemies. When the chant is completed, the THAC0, damage, and saving throws of those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain a +1 bonus, while those hostile to the priest suffer a -1 penalty. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Charm Person or Animal</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Animal
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 person or animal
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell affects any single person or animal that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. If the target fails their save vs. spell, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.
<br>
<br>If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.
<br>
<br><strong>Find Traps</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Divination
<br>Sphere: Divination
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a priest casts this spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to them. Once per round, all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can create a sudden or unexpected result, the caster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus, "traps" include glyphs and similar spells and devices.
<br>
<br><strong>Flame Blade</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from their hand, dealing 2D6 + 1 fire damage upon a successful hit. The caster wields this blade-like ray as if proficient with the weapon and at their normal base THAC0, and it is considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit. This enchantment level increases by one for every three extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 9th level. Since the blade is immaterial, strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the flame blade are considered melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The flame blade can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Hold Person</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Charm, Law
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the target selected by the caster, and every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Creatures who make a save vs. spell are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.
<br>
<br>Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.
<br>
<br><strong>Know Opponent</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Divination
<br>Sphere: Divination
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the priest's eyes glow with magical energy, enabling them to read the aura of the target and determine their strengths and weaknesses. For the duration of the spell, the target's physical resistances are lowered by 10% and all attacks against them are made with a +2 bonus to THAC0. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Opponent spell, and the spell has no effect on creatures who don't emanate auras, such as constructs. Magic resistance does not affect this spell, and multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Resist Elements</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Protection
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon the casting of this spell, the recipient gains a +25% bonus to elemental resistance (fire, cold, electricity, and acid). Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Silence</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Guardian
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast unless an affected creature then casts Vocalize. All enemies in the area must make a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty or be silenced for the duration of the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Slow Poison</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Sphere: Healing
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast upon a poisoned individual, it greatly slows the effects of poisons and vemons, actually neutralizing all but the most deadly of afflictions.
<br>
<br><strong>Spiritual Hammer</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Sphere: Combat
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By calling upon their deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. For as long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it can be used to strike at any opponents within 20 feet, dealing 1D8 + 1 magic damage upon a successful hit. The caster wields the spiritual hammer as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and it functions as a magical weapon with an enchantment bonus of +1 (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses). Starting at level 5, this enchantment level increases by one for every five experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +5 at 25th level. Due to its ethereal nature, strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the spiritual weapon are considered melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The spiritual hammer can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.

<br><strong>Call Lightning</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Weather
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: 360' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>Immediately upon completion of the spell and once per round thereafter, the caster causes a 30-foot-long vertical bolt of lightning to come crashing down upon an enemy. The spell calls forth one lightning bolt for every three experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5 lightning bolts at 15th level. The lightning will strike first at the target of the spell, dealing 6D6 electrical damage. Those who make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty will receive only half damage. For the remainder of the storm's duration, the bolts will strike out randomly at the enemies of the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Remove Magic</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: All
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experence level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the level of the magic they are trying to dispel, their chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the level of the magic they attempt to dispel, their chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Glyph of Warding</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Guardian
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any enemy violating the warded area will trigger the trap.
<br>
<br>When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The glyph deals 1D4 electrical damage per experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. breath will receive only half damage. This spell will not harm party members.
<br>
<br><strong>Hold Person or Animal</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Animal
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell holds persons and animals rigidly immobile and in place. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. The effect is centered on the target selected by the caster, and every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Creatures who make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.
<br>
<br>Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.
<br>
<br><strong>Break Enchantment</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: All
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the caster is able to free a victim from enchantments and curses. The spell can reverse the effects of confusion, deafness, feeblemindedness, hold, petrification, and silence, free a victim from magical fear, sleep, and charm, and break the effects of a curse. Note that Break Enchantment cannot remove the curse from a shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, but allows those affected with any such cursed item to be free of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or through a particular ritual.
<br>
<br><strong>Remove Paralysis</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Necromantic, Protection
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By the use of this spell, the priest can free several creatures from the effects of any paralyzation or related magic (such as a ghoul's touch, a Hold spell, or Power Word Stun).
<br>
<br><strong>Invisibility Purge</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Wards
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Sight
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a priest casts this spell, they become able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any creatures that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. Instantly and at the end of each round for 1 turn after the spell is cast, all concealed enemies within sight of the caster will become visible to the caster and their allies. Creatures affected by improved invisibility will be revealed to the party, but can only be directly targetable with spellcasting by the caster of this spell. Invisible objects carried into the warded area will also become visible. This spell does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Miscast Magic</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Chaos
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>Miscast Magic causes spells cast by the affected creature to take on an effect different from what they intend, similar to what happens during a wild surge. There is a chance that the result will be beneficial to the caster, but generally, the effects are undesirable. The target must make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty to avoid their spells being miscast for the duration of the spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Rigid Thinking</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Thought
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell causes confusion to the target, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The victim must save vs. spell or either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures tend to move as far from the caster as possible, but any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to their basic nature. The target has a saving throw penalty of -2, and there is an additional -1 for every extra two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level.
<br>
<br><strong>Strength of One</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Law
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, all party members within 30 feet of the caster gain a +2 bonus to strength. If a party member ends up with a strength value of 18, then their strength will be set to 18/75. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Holy Smite</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Sphere: Necromantic
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell partial
<br>
<br>With this spell the priest draws down holy power to smite their enemies. Opponents within the area of effect suffer 1D4 magic damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. spell will receive only half damage, while those who fail their saving throw will also be blinded for 1 round.
<br>
<br><strong>Unholy Blight</strong>

<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell partial
<br>
<br>With this spell the priest calls up unholy power to smite their enemies. The power takes the form of a chilling, cloying miasma of darkness. Opponents within the area of effect suffer 1D4 magic damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. spell will receive only half damage, while those who fail their save will also receive a -2 penalty to THAC0 and saving throws for 5 rounds.
<br>
<br><strong>Cure Disease</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Healing
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By laying their hands upon a sickly person, the caster can cure almost any disease, including blindness and deafness, with this spell. The cure is permanent, but this does not grant the recipient of the spell immunity from further afflictions. However, some powerful magically created diseases may not be curable by this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Zone of Sweet Air</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Wards, Elemental (Air)
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors (including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill). Instantly and at the end of each round for 5 rounds after the spell is cast, all clouds in the entire area that the caster is currently in will be dismissed. The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a dragon's breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon).
<br>
<br><strong>Summon Insects</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Sphere: Animal
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>The Summon Insects spell attracts a cloud of insects to attack one target. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster, and attacks the creature the caster points to.
<br>
<br>For the duration of the spell, the target fights with a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Every round, the target must also make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty or suffer 100% chance of spell failure and 4D2 piercing damage from insect bites. A successful saving throw allows the target to avoid most of the swarm and receive only half damage while completely negating the spell failure. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Animal Summoning III</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Conjuration

<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns

<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster calls a number of animals that serve the summoner. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the druid casting the spell. The summoned animals will aid the caster under any condition and by whatever means they possess, staying until the spell duration expires.

The spell expires once the priest makes a successful melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0) or after 1 turn has passed. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell turns natural weapons (such as teeth, claws, etc.) of friendly animals within the area of effect into magical weapons, effectively granting a +1 enhancement bonus to THAC0 and damage.

<br>
<br><strong>Spike Growth</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Alteration

<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster causes the ground to sprout vicious spikes and thorns that catch and prick all creatures in the area of effect. Those caught in the spike growth suffer 2D4 piercing damage every round that they remain within the affected area. The spikes can also embed themselves in victims' legs, causing them to suffer 50% reduced movement speed and 1 bleeding damage every round for two rounds. Those who save vs. breath will receive only half damage and avoid the reduced movement rate and bleeding. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the small spikes.

<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Dispel Magic dispels the magical effects upon any creatures within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experience level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic they are trying to dispel, their chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic they attempt to dispel, their chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

<br><strong>Free Action</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Sphere: Charm
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 1 turn/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>While under the effects of this spell, the recipient becomes immune to everything, magical or otherwise, that limits their mobility in any way. This includes but is not limited to Entangle, Grease, Web, Hold, Slow, and Stun.
<br>
<br><strong>Neutralize Poison</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Sphere: Healing
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 1 turn/level
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell removes all toxins from the body, both natural and magical in nature. When this spell is cast upon a poisoned individual, it immediately neutralizes any poison. In addition, for the duration of the spell, the recipient is immune to any poison it is exposed to, and spells like Poison and Cloudkill won't affect the protected creature.
<br>
<br><strong>Mental Domination</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Sphere: Thought
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When cast, the target must successfully save vs. spell at a -2 penalty to avoid being mentally dominated. While mentally dominated, the priest is simply able to command the target to perform certain tasks or functions for the duration of the spell, though the priest must be within visual range to be able to give them commands. The effects of this spell are similar to the 5th level arcane spell Domination, but this spell does not give the priest access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus.
<br>
<br>If the caster attempts to harm the dominated creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more domination effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent domination takes precedence.
<br>

<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 10' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Defensive Harmony grants the affected creatures a defensive bonus by enhancing the coordination of their attacks and defenses. This allows a group of creatures to act as a cohesive unit for a single battle or encounter. The effect is always centered on the caster, but affects all those within a 10 foot radius. The affected creatures can move outside of this radius after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of Defensive Harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +4 bonus to AC. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

<br>
<br>Through this spell, the caster imbues themselves with the strength and skill of a fighter of the same level. The priest's strength is set to 18/00 (even if it is normally higher) and their THAC0 becomes that of a fighter of the same level. They also gain 1 temporary hit point for every experience level, up to a maximum of 20 at 20th level. Finally, the caster's attack per rounds is set to that of a fighter of the same level, up to a maximum of two attacks per round at 13th level. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br>NOTE: This spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/clerics and ranger/clerics if they have already received them as a part of their class, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter or ranger experience levels.
<br>
<br><strong>Negative Plane Protection</strong>

This spell also affords the recipient partial protection from monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain levels.

On a successful touch from the priest, the target suffers 4D10 + 4/two levels magic damage, up to a maximum of 4D10 + 40 at 20th level.

<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster.
<br>
<br>The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, leaving them physically and mentally exhausted. For 5 rounds after the spell is cast, the priest will suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, AC, and casting speed.

<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature

<br>
<br><strong>Polymorph Other</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Animal
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Permanent
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Polymorph negates
<br>
<br>Polymorph Other is a powerful spell that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental characteristics are not affected and they do not receive any special abilities for their new form, but physical characteristics are changed to adhere to their new form and they lose any special abilities they had in their original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the target into a squirrel unless they make a save vs. polymorph. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with 1-5 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -4 penalty, those with 6-10 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -2 penalty, those with 11-15 HD/levels or more make their saving throw with no penalty, and those who with more than 15 HD/levels make their saving throw at a +2 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent, or until dispelled.
<br>
<br>Note that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once they die or the effects are dispelled.

<br>Area of Effect: Sight
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>

Finally, the caster is also cured of and granted immunity to blindness as well as hostile illusion spells such as Spook and Shadow Door for the duration of the spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>NOTE: True Seeing does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by Mislead or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions.
<br>
<br><strong>Stoneskin</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a druid casts this powerful spell upon themselves, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding them. and its purpose is to protect the mage from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two experience levels of the caster, and for each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack. For example, a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against them, but the sixth would affect them normally. The skins will remain on the druid for the duration of the spell, until all of the skins are destroyed by physical attacks, or until they are affected by a dispel magic.
<br>
<br>It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area of effect attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of dealing some type of elemental damage will still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

At the start of each round after the first, those affected make another saving throw in an attempt to break free from the spell. After one turn, any creatures still sleeping will awaken.

<br>Saving Throw: Poison partial
<br>
<br>Dolorous Decay is a rotting and withering of the body that affects a single living creature.

The target must also make a save vs. poison at a -4 penalty or suffer 1 poison damage every second for the duration of the spell.

<br>Duration: 2 turns
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the form of an invisible disk that protects the caster but also distorts their appearance as if a mirrored image of the caster traveled alongside them. Any missile attack that intersects the disk is instantly deflected, while there is a 50% chance that melee attackers will attack the mirrored image instead of the caster. If the image is struck, then it will temporarily disappear before reappearing the next round. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects will not create additional images.

Furhermore, creatures in the area of effect continue to burn after the initial blast, suffering an additional 1D6 fire damage every round for 1 turn. Those who make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty receive only half damage. The gem can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell or until used.

<br>This spell summons forth a shambling mound to assist the caster. The shambler appears to be heaps of rotting vegetation, but it is actually an intelligent form of plant life, with a roughly humanoid shape, and a brain-like control center in its "chest" area. The shambling mound will remain under the caster's control until it is slain or the spell duration expires.

<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Priests are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity.

<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 7
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation. The caster becomes the very ideal of beauty - for a male, this is usually a nymph or a dryad, while for a female, the image varies. The transformation is instantaneous, but lasts only seconds, and any person (excluding party members) viewing the illusion must save vs. spell at a -4 penalty or be charmed for 1 turn. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the affected creatures fail their saving throws, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creatures will carry them out as quickly as possible.
<br>
<br>If the caster attempts to harm a charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creatures resume their previous behavior prior to being charmed.

<br>
<br>When a Fire Storm spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame and then pelted with fiery balls of lava.

<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it causes a ray of sunlight to beam down upon the caster and a globe of searing radiance to explode in a 30 foot radius. All hostile creatures in the area of effect are blinded for 1 turn. Living creatures suffer 10D6 fire damage, while undead creatures caught within the sunburst instead suffer 1D6 fire damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 20D6 at 20th level. A successful save vs. breath at a -4 penalty negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half. The burst also results in the destruction of all undead creatures specifically averse to bright light (such as vampires, shadows, and wraiths) that fail a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>Saving Throw: Death partial
<br>
<br>This spell snuffs out the chosen target's life force. The caster points their finger at the victim once the incantation is complete and death occurs unless a save vs. death at a -4 penalty is made.

<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>

<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>A Greater Restoration spell removes most temporary and permanent negative effects from the target creature. It reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature caused by any force, spell, or monster. It can restore a polymorphed or petrified creature to its natural form, break the effects of a curse, reverse unnatural mental states such as confusion, feeblemindedness, and berserk rages, and free the recipient from magical effects like fear, paralysis, sleep, and stun. This potent spell will also restore any lost hit points and cure the target of any diseases or poisons.
<br>
<br>The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, leaving them physically and mentally exhausted. For 5 rounds after the spell is cast, the priest will suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, AC, and casting speed.

<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, they call forth a horde of venomous, biting, and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, first attacking the target and then spreading to all other enemies within 30 feet of the target.
<br>
<br>For the duration of the spell, the affected creatures fight with a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Every round, they must also make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty or suffer 100% chance of spell failure and 8D2 piercing damage from insect bites. A successful saving throw allows those affected to avoid most of the swarm and receive only half damage while completely negating the spell failure. They must also make a save vs. death at a -2 penalty or be poisoned, suffering 1 poison damage every second for that round. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips through the ground. There are a total of three tremors that are caused by the earthquake, which are staggered and occur once per round starting immediately upon the completion of the spell. The eartquake affects everyone (except earth elementals and flying creatures) in the area of affect, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The first tremor causes all creatures to fall to the ground for two rounds and suffer 6D6 crushing damage, but those who successfully save vs. death at a -6 penalty will receive only half damage and avoid falling down. The second tremor is less severe than the first, but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth. Creatures in the area of effect suffer 4D6 crushing damage (a successful save vs. death at a -4 penalty reduces it by half), and they also have a 25% chance of stepping and falling into a fissure, and must successfully make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty or die. The final tremor is the least severe of the three, and creatures suffer 2D6 crushing damage (a successful save vs. death at a -2 penalty reduces it by half). During this final tremor, there is also a 10% chance of falling and becoming trapped within a fissure, and creatures must save vs. breath at a -2 penalty or die. Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.

Creatures who currently have more than 60 hit points are immune to this effect.

<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes the caster to be enveloped by an aura of intense flame that both injures opponents and protects the caster from damage. This shield not only grants the caster 100% fire resistance and protects them from all non-magical weapons, but can also damage creatures within a 5 foot radius and enflame weapons held by the caster. Opponents that hit the caster with a weapon or spell from within this radius will suffer 1D8 + 10 fire damage, and whenever the caster strikes an opponent with a melee weapon, they deal an additional 1D8 fire damage. Tiny insects cannot pass through the aura. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell partial
<br>
<br>This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly towards its target, dealing magic damage and causing different effects depending upon its color. As the level of the caster improves, both the damage dealt and number of colors known increases. The color of any given orb is chosen randomly from the colors known at the mage's level, and the orb is occasionally even multicolored, causing multiple effects. The target cannot avoid the initial damage, but can save vs. spell to negate the secondary effects.

<strong>Grease</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 10' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>This spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. breath at a +2 bonus or fall to the ground for one round. Those who enter the area or remain within it must make a saving throw each round until they reach the nearest non-greased surface. A creature that successfully makes their saving throw can walk within and through the grease but will have their movements slowed considerably. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the greasy coating.
<br>
<br><strong>Mage Armor</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical force field that sets their base AC to 6 and improves by 1 for every four extra experience levels of the caster, up to a minimum base AC of 4 at 9th level. This spell will not function with any other form of magical body armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity and other AC bonuses. The mage armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. The armor lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.
<br>
<br><strong>Burning Hands</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Special
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When the wizard casts this spell, a cone of searing flames shoots from their fingertips towards the designated point. Their hands must be held so as to send forth a fan-like sheet of flames: the wizard's thumbs must touch each other and their fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out 10-foot-long jets of flame in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the caster. All creatures caught in the flames suffer 1D6 fire damage as well an additional 1D6 fire damage for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5D6 at 9th level.
<br>
<br><strong>Charm Person</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 person
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell affects any single person that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the target fails their save vs. spell at a +2 bonus, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.
<br>
<br>If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.
<br>
<br><strong>Color Spray</strong>

<br>School: Alteration

<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from their hand. The spray is 20 feet in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the caster, while the effects differ depending upon the experience level of the caster and those affected. The effects are concurrent and cumulative.
<br>
<br>Target's Hit Dice - Effects of Color Spray
<br> All enemies - Confusion for 1 round
<br> 2 more than caster - Blindness for 2 rounds

<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a misty bank of fog billows out from the designated point, obscuring all sight. Everyone within the cloud suffers a -2 penalty to THAC0 while their visibility range is reduced by half, and anyone inside or outside the cloud trying to attack a creature concealed by the fog with ranged weapons will do so with a -4 penalty to THAC0. Creatures that do not rely on sight can fight within the cloud without penalties.

<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the wizard under any and all conditions. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell. The summoned creatures will remain under the caster's control until they are slain or the spell duration expires.

<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When cast, this spell provides all party members in the area with amazing fleetness of foot. Their movement rate is tripled for the duration of the spell, but the excessively unnatural speed prevents them from effectively taking most other actions except for running, causing affected party members to suffer a -20 penalty to THAC0 and 100% spell failure. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell transports the caster to any place within sight. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, which they immediately step through. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds themselves at their chosen destination. The caster always arrives at exactly the spot desired, and the portal doesn't allow anyone or anything else to pass through. Spells about to be cast upon the wizard will fail, and missiles about to hit them will instead hit thin air.

<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: first, all attacks made by evil creatures against the protected creature receive a -2 penalty to their THAC0, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.
<br>

<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard. The fluctuating force shield acts similarly to a regular shield, granting the caster a +2 bonus to AC (+4 vs. missile weapons) and immunity to the spell Magic Missile. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

This surge deals 1D6 electrical damage and an additional 1D6 electrical damage for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5D6 at 9th level. The target must also save vs. breath or be stunned for 1 round. The spell expires once the caster makes a successful melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0) or after 1 turn has passed.

<br>When a wizard casts this spell, they cause a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures. Creatures in the area of effect must make a save vs. spell or fall asleep for the duration of the spell, though any further attempts to harm the targets will awaken them. Enemies that are higher level than the caster are unaffected by this spell. Elves and half-elves are particularly resistant to sleep effects, while the undead and certain other creatures such as dragons and elementals are completely immune to magically-induced sleep.
<br>

<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a creature and adds it to their own. The target suffers 2 magic damage, which  increases by 2 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 10 at 9th level. These hit points are then added to the caster's current hit points, and any hit points over the caster's normal maximum are treated as additional maximum hit points that last for 1 turn.

<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the wizard creates one illusory image of themselves that will travel alongside them. The image performs all of the actions that the wizard does, and there is a 50% chance that an attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that they will attack the caster. If the image is struck, then it will temporarily disappear before reappearing the next round. The image will also disappear if a dispel magic or a detect illusion spell is cast upon it. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects will not create additional images.

<br>This spell enables the caster to summon a familiar to act as their aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with them, and serving as a guard, scout, and spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and they have no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all. Note that this spell may only be cast by the protagonist.
<br>
<br>The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total hit points as bonus hit points. However, the caster must take care to treat their familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster will lose the bonus hit points and half the familiar's hit points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of constitution permanently.
<br>
<br>For example, a wizard has 15 hit points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 24 hit points, so the caster gets a bonus of 12 hit points and now has 27 hit points. If the familiar dies, the caster will lose those additional 12 hit points (putting them back at 15), permanently lose 1 point of constitution (which may cause additional hit point loss), and take an additional 12 damage.
<br>
<br>Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:
<br>
<br>LAWFUL GOOD: Pseudodragon
<br>NEUTRAL GOOD: Psuedodragon
<br>CHAOTIC GOOD: Fairy Dragon
<br>
<br>LAWFUL NEUTRAL: Ferret
<br>TRUE NEUTRAL: Rabbit
<br>CHAOTIC NEUTRAL: Cat
<br>
<br>LAWFUL EVIL: Imp
<br>NEUTRAL EVIL: Dust Mephit
<br>CHAOTIC EVIL: Quasit
<br>

<br><strong>Nahal's Reckless Dweomer</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This spell is the wild mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the wizard releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.
<br>
<br>To use Reckless Dweomer, simply cast it and then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (found in your manual).
<br>
<br>Because the release of energy is planned by the wizard, their level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the wizard has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the wizard or it may be completely disastrous: this is the risk the wizard takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.
<br>
<br><strong>Spook</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not successfully make a save vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the caster as possible. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead creatures, certain powerful creatures who can easily discern the illusion such as dragons, and those with no intelligence score are unaffected by this spell, as are creatures under the effects of a True Seeing spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Detect Alignment</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell allows the wizard to search out the feelings of all creatures within the current area. When affected by this spell, a target will briefly glow red if they're evil, green if they're good, and white if they're neutral. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Friends</strong>
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain a +5 bonus to charisma. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with them and make an effort to be their friends and help them, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax information; and attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking them captive instead.

<br><strong>Blur</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes the wizard's form and spirit to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all attacks against the caster to be made with a -3 penalty, while all saving throws vs. spell are made by the caster with a +3 bonus. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Detect Invisibility</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Sight
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a wizard casts this spell, they become able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any creatures that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. Instantly and at the end of each round for 5 rounds after the spell is cast, all concealed enemies within sight of the caster will become visible to the caster and their allies. Invisible objects carried into the warded area will also become visible. Creatures affected by improved invisibility will be revealed to the party, but can only be directly targetable with spellcasting by the caster of this spell. This spell does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Horror</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, all enemies within the area of effect must save vs. spell or flee in terror. Certain creatures are immune to fear, including undead.
<br>
<br><strong>Invisibility</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around them such as opening doors, disarming traps, or opening chests. An invisible creature can drink a potion, or cast non-attack spells centered on themselves and remain invisible, but they cannot attack nor cast spells on other targets without ending the spell. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, the recipient attacks any creature, or the duration has expired.
<br>
<br><strong>Battering Ram</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>This spell creates a ram-like force that can strike with considerable power. The ram can be used to open or smash locked, held, or magic-locked doors, as well as locked boxes or chests, but it does not raise barred gates or similar impediments. If used against a creature, the target suffers 2D8 crushing damage, and must save vs. breath at a -2 penalty to avoid being knocked away unconscious for 1 round.
<br>
<br><strong>Know Opponent</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard's eyes glow with magical energy, enabling them to read the aura of the target and determine their strengths and weaknesses. For the duration of the spell, the target's physical resistances are lowered by 10% and all attacks against them are made with a +2 bonus to THAC0. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Opponent spell, and the spell has no effect on creatures who don't emanate auras, such as constructs. Magic resistance does not affect this spell, and multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Luck</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The recipient of this spell is lucky in everything that they do for the next hour. The affected character receives a +1 or +5% bonus to all of their actions, including THAC0, damage, AC, saving throws, and thieving skills. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Resist Fear</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The wizard instills courage in allies, raising their morale to its highest. If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated, and they are protected from it for the duration of the spell. The instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Melf's Acid Arrow</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 round/3 levels
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical arrow that speeds to its target unerringly. The arrow deals 1D6 + 2 missile damage and 2D4 acid damage, and will deal an additional 2D4 acid damage at the end of each round for the duration of the spell, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 15th level.
<br>
<br><strong>Mirror Image</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is invoked, the wizard causes a number of illusory duplicates of themselves to come into being around them. The spell creates two images plus one for every three experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level. These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects will not create additional images.
<br>
<br><strong>Stinking Cloud</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Poison negates
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a billowing mass of nauseous vapors appears centered on a point selected by the caster. Any creature caught within the cloud must make a save vs. poison or be nauseated for 1 round. Nauseated characters are unable to attack or cast spells, but can still move. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A dispel magic will temporarily remove the nausea from a particular character, but they will continue to be subjected to the spell's effects so long as they remain within the cloud. Certain creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud, including all undead, and creatures who don't need to breathe, such as elementals.
<br>
<br><strong>Strength</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: 1 turn/level
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Application of this spell sets the strength of the character to 18 and then adds 50 exceptional strength on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then their strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then their strength will become 18/50 + the original percentage. If their strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more.
<br>
<br><strong>Web</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath negates
<br>
<br>A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 20 feet in radius. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Creatures that make a save vs. breath can move at half speed through the area, but must make additional saving throws each round they remain in the area of effect. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs, unable to move for that round. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are spiders and exceptionally large and strong creatures who suffer little to no distress from the webs.
<br>
<br><strong>Agannazar's Scorcher</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. The targeted creature will be hit by this flame for 3D6 damage, and the fiery ray will persist for one further round, burning the victim for another 3D6 fire damage. Other creatures who cross the path of the flame jet will also take damage as long as they stand in the flame. There is no saving throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as fire resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage.
<br>
<br><strong>Ghoul Touch</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: Death partial
<br>
<br>When the caster completes this spell, a red glow encompasses their hand. On successful touches from the caster, the spell deals 1D8 magic damage and paralyzes the target for 5 rounds (save vs. death at -2 neg. paralysis). The wizard gains a +4 bonus to THAC0 and their touch is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit. The touch effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
<br>
<br><strong>Vocalize</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The recipient of this spell gains the ability to cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise. Effectively, this spell cancels the silenced effect and makes the recipient immune to it for the spell's duration. This spell has no effect on other noises or speech - it simply removes a spell's verbal component.
<br>
<br><strong>Power Word: Sleep</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When this power word is uttered, the target enters a comatose slumber for 5 rounds. The target can save vs. spell at a -2 penalty to avoid the effect, though creatures with 1 to 19 hit points are powerless to resist. Note that if a creature is weakened so that its hit points are below its usual maximum, its current number of hit points are used to determine the spell's effect. Elves and half-elves are particularly resistant to sleep effects, while the undead and other certain creatures such as dragons and elementals are completely immune to magically-induced sleep.
<br>
<br><strong>Ray of Enfeeblement</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, a wizard weakens an opponent, sapping their strength and the attacks that rely upon it. The victim suffers a -4 penalty to THAC0 and damage, and their movement speed is reduced by half. A successful save vs. spell at a -2 penalty negates all effects.
<br>
<br><strong>Chaos Shield</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Chaos Shield increases a wild mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a wild surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the wild surge chart, an extra 15 is added to the dice roll. When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Chaos Shield stacks with the wild mage's level bonus.
<br>
<br><strong>Sound Burst</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 10'
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>This spell blasts an area with a tremendous cacophony. Enemies within the area suffer 5D4 crushing damage, and must save vs. breath at a -2 penalty or be deafened for one turn. Deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spell. Deafness caused by this spell may be cured by a Dispel Magic, Cure Disease, Heal, or Greater Restoration spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Glitterdust</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 10' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This spell creates a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to THAC0) for 5 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 5 rounds. Creatures failing their saving throw remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.
<br>
<br><strong>Resist Elements</strong>
<br>Level: 2
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level

<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the wizard under any and all conditions. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell. The summoned creatures will remain under the caster's control until they are slain or the spell duration expires.

<br><strong>Clairvoyance</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell grants an unnatural perception of things to come. Once cast, the wizard receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm, giving them a general idea of what action might be taken to best protect oneself. The caster becomes impossible to surprise and cannot be backstabbed, and receives a +2 bonus to AC and a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. breath.
<br>
<br><strong>Remove Magic</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experience level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the level of the magic they are trying to dispel, their chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the level of the magic they attempt to dispel, their chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Flame Arrow</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell enables the wizard to hurl flaming arrows at their enemies. The caster receives one arrow for every two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of five at 10th level. Each arrow deals 1D6 + 3 missile damage and 1D6 fire damage. Upon completion of the spell, the first arrow will streak towards the creature targeted by the caster, while additional arrows will randomly target opponents within visual range of the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Fireball</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>A fireball is an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar, delivering fire damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it. The wizard points their finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless impacting upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). The fireball deals 1D6 fire damage for each level of experience of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D6 at 10th level. Creatures who save vs. breath at a -2 penalty manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, and receive only half damage from the blast.
<br>
<br><strong>Haste</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, all affected creatures gain a +4 bonus to their normal movement rate and receive an extra half attack per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected, though Haste negates and counters the effects of a Slow spell. Note that affected creatures expend as much energy during this spell as they would normally in a whole day, causing them to become exhausted for 2 rounds after the duration of the spell. While exhausted, the affected creatures suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, and AC. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected, though Haste negates and counters the effects of a Slow spell. This spell is not cumulative with itself or other similar magic.
<br>
<br><strong>Hold Person</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the target selected by the caster, and every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Creatures who make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.
<br>
<br>Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.

<br><strong>Invisibility Sphere</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 10' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell confers invisibility upon all friendly creatures within 10 feet of the caster. Creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect, while those entering the area after the casting is completed are not. If an affected creature makes an attack, they will negate the invisibility, but only for themselves.
<br>
<br><strong>Lightning Bolt</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy towards the target that deals 1D6 electrical damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D6 at 10th level. A successful save vs. breath at a -4 penalty reduces the damage by half.
<br>

<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the wizard under any and all conditions. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell. The summoned creatures will remain under the caster's control until they are slain or the spell duration expires.

<br><strong>Non-Detection</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By casting this spell, the wizard makes the recipient undetectable by spells and abilities such as Oracle, True Seeing, and the Detect Illusion ability, though they may still be audible when moving and their presence may still be sensed. This spell wards the recipient's equipment as well as the creature itself.
<br>
<br><strong>Protection from Missiles</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the wizard bestows upon a creature total invulnerability to hurled and projected missiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, and sling stones. Magically created missiles like Melf's Acid Arrows, Flame Arrows, and Melf's Minute Meteors can be deflected, while magical projectiles like Lightning Bolts, Fireballs, and Magic Missiles cannot be.
<br>
<br><strong>Slow</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Polymorph negates
<br>
<br>This spell causes creatures to move, attack, and cast spells at half of their normal rates unless a save vs. polymorph at a -2 penalty is made. Slowed creatures also suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC and a -3 penalty to saving throws vs. breath. Additionally, the rate at which slowed creatures regenerate or suffer damage from poison is halved, and the effects of a Haste spell are negated. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Skull Trap</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the caster hurls a magical skull at the chosen area, where it is stationary and floats until a creature comes within 15'. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes, and opponents within 20' suffer 1D6 magic damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D6 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty will receive only half damage. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party to prevent it from being set off accidentally.
<br>
<br><strong>Vampiric Touch</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the target suffers 3 hit points for every two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 30 at 20th level. These hit points are then added to the caster's current hit points, and any hit points over the caster's normal maximum are treated as additional maximum hit points that last for 1 turn.
<br>
<br>NOTE: This may spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's maximum hit points. However, the caster may still use the spell to heal themselves even while another instance of the spell is in effect.
<br>
<br><strong>Wraithform</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of their gear become insubstantial. As an incorpreal creature, the caster moves silently and cannot be heard or backstabbed, and is vulnerable only to magical attacks of +1 enchantment or better (or by creatures otherwise able to affect those vulnerable only to magical weapons). Non-damaging spell effects affect the caster normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (e.g. Polymorph Other, Flesh to Stone, Disintegrate, and Implosion) or create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (e.g. Entangle, Grease, and Web).
<br>
<br>While in wraith form, the caster also has a base AC of 4 and is immune to the effects of disease and poison, but is unable to cast spells. Any melee attack made while in wraith form is considered a melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0), while projectiles become corporeal as soon as they are fired. The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.
<br>
<br><strong>Dire Charm</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with two differences: the saving throw has no bonus, and the enchantment has a longer duration. This spell affects any single person that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the target fails their save vs. spell, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.
<br>
<br>If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.
<br>
<br><strong>Ghost Armor</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard creates an insubstantial but quasi-real suit of armor. This semi-illusory material covers the recipient and actually gives some real protection so long as opponents do not actively disbelieve in it by detecting the illusion. When cast, the ghostly nimbus of light surrounds the recipient, setting their base AC to 2 and granting a +20% bonus to Hide in Shadows. This spell will not function with any other form of magical body armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity and other AC bonuses. The ghost armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. The armor lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully detected or dispelled.
<br>
<br><strong>Minor Spell Deflection</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 6 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 4th level spell. Spells greater than 4th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.
<br>
<br>Spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities are also absorbed, but stationary area of effect spells such as Ice Storm or Cloudkill are not.
<br>
<br><strong>Spell Thrust</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it will dispel one spell protection of 5th level or lower on all enemies within the area of effect. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The spell protection spells dispelled by Spell Thrust are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, and Spell Shield.
<br>
<br><strong>Detect Illusion</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast at a point designated by the wizard, an area roughly 30 feet in radius will be affected. All hostile illusion spells of 4th level and lower in this area will be dispelled. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The illusion spells dispelled by Detect Illusion are: Reflected Image, Blur, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Ghost Armor, Invisibility Sphere, and Improved Invisibility.
<br>
<br><strong>Halt Undead</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell stops undead creatures in their place for the duration of the spell. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any undead creatures within 5 feet of the target are also affected. Those who succeed at a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>Those affected become unable move or groan, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence the effect does not stop any worsening of their condition due to injury or rot.
<br>
<br><strong>Melf's Minute Meteors</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell enables the wizard to summon one small globe of fire for each experience level of the caster, which, when thrown, burst upon impact and deal 1D4 + 2 piercing damage and 2D4 fire damage to the creature struck. The wizard gains a +5 bonus to THAC0 with the missiles, and each meteor is considered to be of +2 enchantment to determine what it can hit. The wizard may discharge up to five missiles per round.
<br>
<br><strong>Dispel Magic</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>Dispel Magic dispels the magical effects upon any creatures within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experience level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic they are trying to dispel, their chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic they attempt to dispel, their chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.
<br>
<br><strong>Icelance</strong>
<br>Level: 3
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 3
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a sharp spear of ice impales the target, dealing 1D6 of both piercing and cold damage for every two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5D6 at 10th level. A successful save vs. breath at a -2 penalty negates the cold damage, though the target must also make a save vs. paralysis at a -2 penalty to avoid being held for one round.


<br><br><h2><a id="arcane4"></a>Level 4 Spells</h2>

<br><strong>Confusion</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell causes confusion to one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All hostile creatures within the area of effect must save vs. spell at a -2 penalty or either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures tend to move as far from the caster as possible, but any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to their basic nature.
<br>
<br><strong>Ice Storm</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, great magical hailstones pound down for 5 rounds within a 30 foot radius of a point selected by the caster. Creatures within the area of effect have their movement speed reduced to 80%, and receive 2D8 cold damage for each round they remain inside the storm.
<br>
<br><strong>Improved Invisibility</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, that enable observant opponents to approximate the invisible character's whereabouts. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for, after the creature has made their presence known. Once the character has revealed themselves, opponents can attempt to attack them with conventional weapons, though they do so with a -4 penalty to the attack roll, or they may cast area of effect spells near their position. Opponents remain unable to directly target the invisible creature with spells, scrolls, or abilities until the spell duration expires or the invisibility is dispelled.
<br>
<br><strong>Minor Globe of Invulnerability</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell, as well as other forms of magical attacks such as Secret Word and Pierce Magic.
<br>
<br><strong>Stoneskin</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon themselves, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding them. and its purpose is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two experience levels of the caster, and for each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack. For example, a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against them, but the sixth would affect them normally. The skins will remain on the caster for the duration of the spell, until all of the skins are destroyed by physical attacks, or until they are affected by a dispel magic.
<br>
<br>It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any area of effect attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of dealing some type of elemental damage will still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Contagion</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Poison negates
<br>
<br>This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature. Every round, the targeted victim must make a save vs. poison at a -2 penalty or suffer a -1 penalty to strength, dexterity, constitution, and charisma, up to a maximum of -5. The characteristic points lost from this spell can only be restored with a Cure Disease, Heal, or Greater Restoration spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Break Enchantment</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the caster is able to free a victim from enchantments and curses. The spell can reverse the effects of confusion, deafness, feeblemindedness, hold, petrification, and silence, free a victim from magical fear, sleep, and charm, and break the effects of a curse. Note that Break Enchantment cannot remove the curse from a shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, but allows those affected with any such cursed item to be free of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or through a particular ritual.
<br>
<br><strong>Emotion: Despair</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 2 rounds/level
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard can disturb the emotional state of those around them, inflicting a feeling of absolute hopelessness upon enemies. Upon a failed save vs. spell at a -2 penalty, those affected will suffer a -4 penalty to THAC0, damage, and AC. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Greater Malison</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 2 rounds/level
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The spell allows the caster to adversely affect the saving throws of their enemies. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect. Those under the influence of this spell make all their saving throws at a penalty of -2, and suffer a -1 penalty to luck. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Otiluke's Resilient Sphere</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature if they fail to make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage. Actually, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful dispel magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world.
<br>
<br>The caster has the option of using the spell to protect their allies. Resistances and saving throws are bypassed when the target is willing.
<br>
<br><strong>Spirit Armor</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell taps the recipient's life force to create a corporeal barrier around their body. When cast, the recipient's AC is set to 0, and saving throws vs. death will be made with a +3 bonus. There is a danger in using this spell, however, as the external portion of the target's spirit is temporarily lost when the spell duration expires, dealing 1D6 damage to the recipient unless they successfully save vs. spell. This spell will not function with any other form of magical body armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity and other AC bonuses. The spirit armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. The armor lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.
<br>
<br><strong>Polymorph Other</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Permanent
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Polymorph negates
<br>
<br>This spell is a powerful incantation that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental characteristics are not affected and they do not receive any special abilities for their new form, but physical characteristics are changed to adhere to their new form and they lose any special abilities they had in their original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the target into a squirrel unless they make a save vs. polymorph. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with 1-5 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -4 penalty, those with 6-10 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -2 penalty, those with 11-15 HD/levels or more make their saving throw with no penalty, and those who with more than 15 HD/levels make their saving throw at a +2 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent, or until dispelled.
<br>
<br>Note that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once they die or the effects are dispelled.
<br>
<br><strong>Polymorph Self</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the forms of six creatures: that of a mustard jelly, an ogre mage, a salamander, a sword spider, a troll, or a winter wolf. For the duration of the spell, the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, as many times as they wish. Physical characteristics are altered to that of the new form, and the caster gains their natural attacks but cannot cast spells while shapeshifted. However, the caster's mental characteristics are not affected, and nor is there a risk of changing their mental capabilities or personality. Additionally, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the caster.

<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell conjures forth a +3 enchanted weapon that can be given to anyone. The weapon may be of any type, or the caster may alternatively decide to conjure 40 magical arrows, bolts, or bullets. The weapon stays in existence for no longer than a day.

<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell protects the wizard by surrounding them with a circular wall of flames. This shield not only grants a +50% bonus to fire and cold resistance, but opponents that hit the caster with a weapon or spell from within a 10' radius will suffer 1D6 + 1/two levels fire damage, up to a maximum of 1D6 + 10 at 20th level. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative, but it can be used in conjunction with other similar spells. Tiny insects cannot pass through the fire shield. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>

<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a Secret Word spell is uttered, it will dispel one spell protection of 7th level or lower on the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The spell protection spells dispelled by Secret Word are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, and Shield of the Archons.

<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell allows a wizard to prepare a magical matrix that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action.

<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>With this spell, the wizard instigates a teleportation effect as far as they can see. All enemies in this area are randomly teleported for the duration of the spell unless they make a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty. This spell is best used against multiple enemies, serving to confuse them and allowing the caster to concentrate on activating their defenses.

<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When Farsight is cast, the caster is able to view an area of an unexplored map. After casting the spell, simply click on a section of the map that you want to view. For the duration of the spell, the caster can spy on that area, noting creatures and fortifications.
<br>
<br><strong>Wizard Eye</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends them visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas and can travel in any direction for as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility, for example), and so solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel cast on the caster or eye ends the spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Protection from Elemental Energy</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 1 turn/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the recipient receives complete protection from one damage type: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. 100% of the damage from the selected source of energy will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of spells based on that element. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative, but each time a different damage type can be selected.
<br>
<br><strong>Vitriolic Sphere</strong>
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and anyone within 10'
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a glowing orb of emerald acid streaks towards the target and explodes, drenching everyone within a 10' radius in potent acid. Each creature in the area immediately suffers 1D4 acid damage for each level of experience of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. After the initial round, those covered in the sphere's acid continue to suffer two less dice of acid damage in the following rounds. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8D4 damage with this spell in the first round, 6D4 in the second round, 4D4 in the third round, and 2D4 in the fourth round. During each round except the first, those affected can make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty to reduce that round's damage by half and avoid further damage in any remaining rounds.

<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly, yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4 hit dice, while creatures with 4 to 6 hit dice must save vs. poison at a -4 penalty to avoid being slain. Those with more than 6 hit dice must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1D10 poison damage each round while in the area of effect. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell, and undead creatures are not affected by the poisonous cloud.

<br>Duration: Instant

<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped spray of extreme cold to spring forth from the wizard's hand. The cone is 30 feet in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of 60 degrees in front of the caster, draining heat and causing 1D4 + 1 cold damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 15D4 + 15 at 15th level.

<br><strong>Shadow Door</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality, they have darted aside and can flee, totally invisible, for the duration of the spell. Opponents within 5 feet of the caster must save vs. spell or be fooled into following the caster through the door, becoming trapped in an extradimensional room for up to 5 rounds. Creatures with exceptional intelligence may escape the illusion faster, while creatures who can see through illusions (e.g. dragons, liches, demons), or who are under the effects of a True Seeing spell, are unaffected.
<br>
<br><strong>Domination</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When cast, the target must successfully save vs. spell at a -2 penalty to avoid being dominated. While dominated, a telepathetic link between the caster and the target is formed, allowing the caster to control their actions for the duration of the spell.
<br>
<br>If the caster attempts to harm the dominated creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more domination effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent domination takes precedence.
<br>
<br><strong>Hold Monster</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell holds creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed at making a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.
<br>
<br>Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.
<br>
<br><strong>Waves of Fatigue</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Surges of negative energy render all hostile living creatures in the spell's area fatigued, as if they haven't rested for a day. While fatigued, they suffer a -2 penalty to luck, movement rate, casting speed, and speed factor. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
<br>
<br><strong>Feeblemind</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Permanent
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>Feeblemind causes the subject's intellect to degenerate into that of a simple beast of burden. The subject remains in this fugue-like state until a successful dispel magic is cast upon them. The victim must make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty in order to resist being stupefied.

<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by non-magical weapons; all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere, then immediately fall to the ground). This does not include weapons that are blessed or enchanted.
<br>
<br><strong>Breach</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast at a creature, it breaches and dispels all of the specific and combat protections on the target creature. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The specific protection spells dispelled by Breach are: Resist Fear, Resist Elements, Death Ward, Free Action, Protection from Acid, Protection from Cold, Protection from Electricity, Protection from Fire, Chaotic Commands, Protection from Magic Energy, Protection from the Elements, and Protection from Energy.
<br>
<br>The combat protection spells dispelled by Breach are: Mage Armor, Shield, Armor of Faith, Barkskin, Protection from Missiles, Spirit Armor, Stoneskin, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons, Physical Mirror, Prismatic Mantle, and Absolute Immunity.
<br>
<br><strong>Lower Resistance</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When cast upon a creature, this spell will lower their magic resistance by 2% for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 50% at 25th level. There is no saving throw against this spell and magic resistance is ignored. This spell is not affected by dispel magic, so once it has been cast, there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.
<br>
<br>For example, if a creature has 50% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th level wizard, then its magic resistance would be lowered to 20%. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell. If this spell was cast upon this same creature again, the creature's magic resistance would be 50% - 30% (initial casting) - 30% (current casting), which would leave the creature with 0% magic resistance after both spells have been cast.
<br>
<br><strong>Oracle</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Sight
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, all hostile illusionary/phantasm spells in sight of the caster will be dispelled. This spell only affects enemies.
<br>
<br>The spells that are affected by this are: Reflected Image, Invisibility, Blur, Mirror Image, Ghost Armor, Invisibility Sphere, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Pixie Dust, Mislead, Project Image, and Mass Invisibility.
<br>
<br><strong>Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental</strong>
<br>Level: 5
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 8
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the caster. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are slain. All of the commands given to the elemental are relayed telepathically, so there is no miscommunication and nor is it necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes, and there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.

<br>Upon casting this spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Air, and an air elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the caster. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are slain. All of the commands given to the elemental are relayed telepathically, so there is no miscommunication and nor is it necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes, and there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.

<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 9 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 7th level spell. Spells greater than 7th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.
<br>
<br>Spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities are also absorbed, but stationary area of effect spells such as Ice Storm or Cloudkill are not.

<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>This spell creates an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it, similar to a fireball. The wizard gestures with their hand and the entire area around them erupts in flames, striking all except the caster and causing 1D6 fire damage for each experience level of the spellcaster, up to a maximum of 15D6 at 15th level. Creatures who save vs. breath at a -4 penalty manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, and receive only half damage from the blast.

<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell conjures a boiling acid barrier around the wizard. The shield grants the caster 50% acid resistance and opponents that hit them with a weapon or spell from within a 10' radius will suffer 2D4 + 1/two levels acid damage, up to a maximum of 2D4 + 10 at 20th level. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative, but it can be used in conjunction with other similar spells. Tiny insects cannot pass through the acid sheath. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This creature obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 8 hours or until it is killed, at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.

<br><strong>Globe of Invulnerability</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell, as well as other forms of magical attack such as Ruby Ray of Reversal and Spellstrike.
<br>
<br><strong>Tenser's Transformation</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. For when the wizard casts the spell, they undergo a startling transformation which alters their body and mind into that of a warrior. The wizard gains 2 hit points per caster level (up to a maximum of 40), and all damage they sustain comes first from the magical points gained. The AC of the caster is 4 better than they possessed prior casting the spell, and all attacks are made with the THAC0 of a fighter of the same level as the caster. The wizard gains extra attacks as a fighter of the same level, thus an extra half attack per round at 7th level and another half attack per round at 13th level. Furthermore, each attack is made at a +2 bonus, each successful hit in combat deals +2 damage, and saving throws against death/poison are made by the caster with a +5 bonus, but casting speed is penalized by 2 and saving throws against spell are made by the caster with a -3 penalty. The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.
<br>
<br>NOTE: This spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/mages if they have already received them as a part of their class, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter experience levels.
<br>
<br><strong>Flesh to Stone</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This incantation is a powerful magic that permanently turns the flesh of the target into stone. When struck by this spell, the affected creature is slowed for 2 rounds as their flesh begins to harden, after which they must make a save vs. petrification at a -4 penalty or be turned into a statue. A dispel magic spell may avert petrification while the creature is merely slowed, but cannot restore the victim's natural form after having already been turned to stone. However, some powerful spells (such as Stone to Flesh or Freedom) may restore the target to flesh and blood. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or incorporeal creatures.
<br>
<br><strong>Banishment</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell forces hostile summoned creatures in the area back to their home plane. Gated creatures (such as fiends, celestials, and elemental princes) may make a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty to resist being banished. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Protection from Magic Energy</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 1 turn/level
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When a Protection from Magic Energy spell is cast, the recipient receives complete protection from all magic damage-based attacks. 100% of the damage from attacks like Cause Wound will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of spells such as Magic Missile, Skull Trap, Disintegrate, and Horrid Wilting. Certain creatures are immune to the effects of this spell, including all undead.
<br>
<br><strong>Mislead</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from their original position. Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where they used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster. The illusory double vanishes after the duration of the spell and cannot perform any actions at all, like attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible wizard. As long as the image isn't destroyed, the caster can attack and cast spells while remaining completely hidden. The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys the illusion.
<br>
<br><strong>Pierce Magic</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Magic are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, and Mind Blank.
<br>
<br><strong>True Seeing</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Divination
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: Sight
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard gains the ability to see the exact locations of creatures or objects under displacement or invisibility effects, as well as see through illusions. Instantly and at the end of each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all concealed enemies within sight of the caster will become visible to the caster and their allies, and minor illusionary spells (including Reflected Image, Blur, and Mirror Image) cast by opponents will be neutralized outright. Creatures affected by improved invisibility will be revealed to the party, but can only be directly targetable with spellcasting by the caster of this spell. Finally, the caster is also cured of and granted immunity to blindness as well as hostile illusion spells such as Spook and Shadow Door for the duration of the spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>NOTE: True Seeing does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by Mislead or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions.
<br>
<br><strong>Protection from Magical Weapons</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 4 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by magical weapons; all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere, then immediately fall to the ground). This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted as well as attacks of especially powerful monsters. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.
<br>
<br><strong>Power Word: Silence</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this power word is uttered, the target becomes unable make any sound for 1 turn. This silence completely foils any spellcasting because it prevents the target from uttering the required verbal components. The only counters to this spell are a Dispel Magic, Break Enchantment, or Vocalize.
<br>
<br><strong>Improved Haste</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, all affected creatures gain a +4 bonus to their normal movement rate and receive an extra attack per round, as well as a +2 bonus to THAC0 and AC and a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. breath. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected, though Improved Haste negates and counters the effects of a Slow spell. Unlike the third level arcane spell Haste, there is no period of exhaustion following the expiration of the spell, and this haste spell cannot be countered by Slow. This spell is not cumulative with itself or other similar magic.
<br>
<br><strong>Acid Fog</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell creates a thick, clinging, greenish cloud. All creatures who aren't immune to acid suffer 10 damage for each round they are exposed to the vapors of the Acid Fog. In addition, due to reduced visibility, creatures inside the cloud move at 50% of their normal rate.
<br>
<br><strong>Chain Lightning</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from the caster's fingertips. Unlike Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies within range, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1D6 damage for every experience level of the caster to the primary target (up to a maximum of 20D6) and 1D6 for every two levels to subsequent targets (up to a maximum of 10D6). Those who make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty manage to partially avoid direct impact from the lightning and hence receive only half damage.
<br>
<br><strong>Disintegrate</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell at another creature, a thin green ray shoots unerringly from the caster's fingertip toward the target. Upon contact, the creature must make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty or suffer 2D6 magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40D6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5D6 damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.
<br>
<br><strong>Contingency</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Universal
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of their repertoire of known spells. The spell level must be lower or equal to the experience level of the caster divided by three. Once the spell is chosen, the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of their maximum hit points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically. For example, a 12th level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of their maximum hit points'. Then once the wizard is reduced to 50% or less of their total hit points in combat, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon them. This requires no action by the caster, happening automatically and instantaneously. The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, the spell stored cannot be an offensive spell nor can it target any other party members.
<br>
<br><strong>Monster Summoning VI</strong>
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the wizard under any and all conditions. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell. The summoned creatures will remain under the caster's control until they are slain or the spell duration expires.

<br>Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By casting this spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, a nishruu. At first glance, this creature appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, the churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to a flame, the nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Nishruus do not use physical attacks: instead, each time a nishruu touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from them. Except for a dispel magic or Banishment, the nishruu is completely immune to magic, and magic will actually heal the nishruu. The creature will remain under the caster's control for the duration of the spell or until slain.

<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 7
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 12 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.
<br>
<br>Spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities are also absorbed, but stationary area of effect spells such as Ice Storm or Cloudkill are not.

<br>Duration: 1 turn/2 levels
<br>Casting Time: 7
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it confers complete protection from all elemental attacks composed of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the elemental damage from attacks with weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of elemental spells.

<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, an illusory copy of the wizard appears to step out of their body while at the same time the wizard is concealed with invisibility. The image can move around, and has the same hit points and can cast the same spells as the caster, but it cannot make any physical attacks. The caster must maintain concentration on the illusory clone for the duration of the spell and cannot perform any other action while controlling it. If the image is destroyed then the spell ends and the caster can move again. If during this time the caster takes any damage, the image will disappear and the caster will be free to move around once more. Otherwise, the image will remain for the duration of the spell or until affected by a dispel magic or destroyed.

<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast it will dispel one spell protection of any level on the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The spell protection spells dispelled by Ruby Ray of Reversal are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, Mind Blank, and Spell Trap.

<br>Casting Time: 7
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast on the target creature, it will dispel one spell protection of up to 8th level or lower. At the beginning of each of the next 3 rounds, another spell protection will be removed from the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The spell protection spells dispelled by Khelben's Warding Whip are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, and Mind Blank.

<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Priests are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity.

<br>Duration: 4 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, an opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light temporarily surrounds the caster. This magical mantle confers complete invulnerability to all weapons of those of +3 or less enchantment and protects the caster from attacks made within a 10' radius of the caster. Opponents that hit the caster with a weapon or spell from within this radius are subject to a random prismatic effect once per round. The possible effects of the prismatic mantle are listed below and all saves are made at a -4 penalty. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.
<br>
<br>Red - 10D6 fire damage (save vs. breath half)
<br>Orange - Stun for 1 turn (save vs. polymorph neg.)
<br>Yellow - 10D6 electrical damage (save vs. breath half)

<br>
<br>This spell allows a wizard to prepare a magical sequencer that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action.

<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>This spell allows the caster to create a sphere of chaotic magic. All enemies within the area must make a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty for every round that they remain in the sphere or suffer one of the following random effects for the following round: berserking, confusion, paralysis, unconsciousness, or panic.
<br>
<br><strong>Delayed Blast Fireball</strong>
<br>Level: 7
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 7
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>This spell creates a fireball that hovers at a point determined by the caster. The fireball will stay in position until someone walks within 20 feet of it. When this happens, the fireball is triggered and explodes, damaging everyone within a 30 foot radius. The explosion will deal 1D6 fire damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster, up to a maximum of 20D6 at 20th level. Creatures who save vs. breath at a -4 penalty manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, and receive only half damage from the blast.
<br>
<br><strong>Finger of Death</strong>
<br>Level: 7
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Long

<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Death partial
<br>
<br>This spell snuffs out the chosen target's life force. The caster points their finger at the victim once the incantation is complete and death occurs unless a save vs. death at a -4 penalty is made. A creature who successfully makes their saving throw still suffers 1D6 magic damage for every two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D6 at 20th level.
<br>
<br><strong>Prismatic Spray</strong>

<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Cone
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard causes seven shimmering, multicolored rays of light to flash from their hand. These include all colors of the visible spectrum, and each ray has a different power and purpose. Any creature that is caught within the area of effect will be touched by one or more rays: there is a 50% chance that they will be affected by two or more rays, and a 25% chance that they will be affected by three rays. Additionally, creatures with 8 hit dice or fewer struck by any type of ray are also blinded for 5 rounds. The effects of the rays are listed below and all saves are made at a -4 penalty.
<br>
<br>Red - 10D6 fire damage (save vs. breath half)
<br>Orange - Stun for 1 turn (save vs. polymorph neg.)
<br>Yellow - 10D6 electrical damage (save vs. breath half)
<br>Green - Death (save vs. poison for 5D4 poison damage)
<br>Blue - 10D6 cold damage (save vs. breath half)

<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this power word is uttered, any creature of the wizard's choice within visual range is stunned for a length of time dependent upon its current hit points. Creatures with 1 to 29 hit points are stunned for 4D4 rounds, those with 30 to 59 are stunned for 2D4 rounds, those with 60 to 89 are stunned for 1D4 rounds, and those with 90 or more are stunned for only 1 round. Note that if a creature is weakened so that its hit points are below its usual maximum, its current number of hit points are used to determine the spell's effect.

<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 7
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the wizard brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the control of the caster for duration of the spell duration or until the sword is dispelled or slain. The sword acts as a +3 weapon in all respects and attacks on its own twice each round, dealing 5D4 damage when it hits a target. The sword is also immune to mild-affecting magic and has near total immunity most forms of damage, but is vulnerable to pure magic damage. Note that this spell does not prevent the caster from performing any other actions while the spell is in effect.

<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By casting this spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, a hakeashar. The hakeashar is a more powerful version of the nishruu. At first glance, this creature appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, the churning grey mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to a flame, the nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Nishruus do not use physical attacks: instead, each time a nishruu touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from them. Except for a dispel magic or Banishment, the nishruu is completely immune to magic, and magic will actually heal the nishruu.

<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 7
<br>Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This spell allows the caster to take control of undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control. There is no saving throw if the undead creature has 5 or more hit dice less than the caster, otherwise a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a dispel magic. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes all friendly creatures within the area of effect to be affected by the spell Improved Invisibility. Creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not.

<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points lost in battle. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Lastly, the wiser the caster, the better chance that they will choose the right wording. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.

<br>Improved Chaos Shield increases a wild mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a wild surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the wild surge chart, an extra 25 is added to the dice roll. When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Improved Chaos Shield stacks with the wild mage's level bonus. The caster may have only one chaos shield at a time.

<br>By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the wizard under any and all conditions.

<br><strong>Ghostform</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 8
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of their gear assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost. As an incorpreal creature, the caster moves silently and cannot be heard or backstabbed, and is vulnerable only to magical attacks of +1 enchantment or better (or by creatures otherwise able to affect those vulnerable only to magical weapons). Even when hit by magical attacks, any physical damage sustained while in ghost form is reduced by 50%. Non-damaging spell effects affect the caster normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (e.g. Polymorph Other, Flesh to Stone, Disintegrate, and Implosion) or create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (e.g. Entangle, Grease, and Web).
<br>
<br>While in ghost form, the caster also has a base AC of 0 and is immune to the effects of disease and poison. Any melee attack made while in ghost form is considered a melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0), while projectiles become corporeal as soon as they are fired. The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.
<br>
<br><strong>Mind Blank</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 8
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions and/or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information-gathering attempts by divination spells or abilities.
<br>
<br><strong>Protection from Energy</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 2 rounds/level
<br>Casting Time: 8
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it confers complete protection from all energy attacks composed of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or magic damage, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the energy damage from attacks with weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of energy-based spells.
<br>
<br><strong>Simulacrum</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the caster taps energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of themselves. The duplicate is a near-perfect copy of the caster, making it a very powerful ally. The simulacrum is created at 60% of the experience level of the caster and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level after having fully rested. It also has 60% of the hit points of the caster. The simulacrum is fully under the control of the caster. The caster may have only one simulacrum at a time.
<br>
<br><strong>Pierce Shield</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 8
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the wizard may launch a massive attack on a target's physical and magical defenses. Pierce Shield will dispel one spell protection of any level from the target creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. After piercing through magical protections, this powerful spell will breach each and every combat protection on the target creature. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Shield are: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, Mind Blank, and Spell Trap.
<br>
<br>The combat protection spells dispelled by Pierce Shield are: Mage Armor, Shield, Armor of Faith, Barkskin, Protection from Missiles, Spirit Armor, Stoneskin, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons, Physical Mirror, Prismatic Mantle, and Absolute Immunity.

<br><strong>Summon Fiend</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Medium
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Glabrezu, one of the most powerful specimen of the Tanar'ri. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Wizards are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated fiend will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity.

<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 4 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell grants an almost omniscient perception of things to come. For the duration of the spell, the wizard gains a +20 bonus to AC and saving throws as well as immunity to backstabbing. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.
<br>
<br><strong>Simbul's Spell Trigger</strong>

<br>School: Universal
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell allows a wizard to prepare a magical trigger that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action. The trigger can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 6th level or lower. A wizard can only possess one spell trigger at a time, and the trigger will remain active until the spells contained within it are released.
<br>
<br><strong>Incendiary Cloud</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 8
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke and roaring flame, which obscures all sight beyond 15 feet (including darkvision). Creatures within the cloud suffer a -4 penalty to THAC0 and AC, and the flames deal 4D6 fire damage each round to everything remaining within the area of effect. A save vs. breath at a -4 penalty reduces the damage by half. Fire dwellers like fire elementals, fire giants, and salamanders are immune to the effects of this spell.
<br>

<br>Level: 8

<br>Area of Effect: 20' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>Symbol of Pain is a powerful enchantment that allows the caster to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, at which point it is triggered and explodes, causing all enemies within a 20 foot radius to make a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty or be stricken with wracking pains, suffering a -4 penalty to THAC0, damage, AC, and saving throws for 1 turn.

<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Death half
<br>
<br>This spell evaporates moisture in the bodies of all living opponents within the area of effect, dealing 1D6 magic damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 20D6 at 20th level. Those who make a save vs. death at a -2 penalty will receive only half damage. Undead creatures are not affected by this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Maze</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>An extradimensional space is brought into being upon utterance of a Maze spell. The subject vanishes into the shifting labyrinth of force planes for a period of time that is dependent upon its intelligence.
<br>
<br>Intelligence - Time trapped in maze
<br> 1 to 2 - eternity
<br> 3 to 5 - 10D4 rounds
<br> 6 to 8 - 5D4 rounds

<br> 12 to 14 - 3D4 rounds
<br> 15 to 17 - 2D4 rounds
<br> 18 and up - 1D4 rounds
<br>
<br>If the 9th level spell Freedom is cast in the area where a creature is mazed, it will immediately bring them back to this plane, ending the spell prematurely. Otherwise, the effect lasts for the duration of the spell. A mazed creature cannot be freed through a dispel magic.
<br>

<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature

<br>
<br>When this power word is uttered, any creature of the wizard's choice within visual range becomes sightless. Creatures with less than 6 hit dice are blinded permanently, while other creatures are blinded for 1 turn or until dispelled. All of the effects of blindness apply to the victim, including a -10 penalty to THAC0 and decreased visibility range.
<br>

<br>
<br>Symbol of Stunning is a powerful enchantment that allows the caster to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface.

<br>
<br><strong>Symbol of Death</strong>
<br>Level: 8
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long

<br>Casting Time: 8
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This spell creates a huge disembodied hand that grabs a victim and pins them to the ground. Each round, the massive hand squeezes the target for 2D8 cold damage and holds them for 1 round.

<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 99 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.
<br>
<br>Spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities are also absorbed, but stationary area of effect spells such as Ice Storm or Cloudkill are not.
<br>
<br><strong>Spellstrike</strong>

<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, it will dispel all spell protections on the target. Additionally, the affected creature will suffer 100% spell failure rate for one round, followed by 50% spell failure for the round after. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>
<br>By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Pit Fiend, the most powerful specimen of the Baatezu. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Wizards are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Pit Fiend will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity, tear them and their allies apart piece by piece and then feast on the remains.

<br>By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the wizard under any and all conditions.

<br><strong>Absolute Immunity</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 4 rounds
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When Absolute Immunity is cast, the caster gains complete invulnerability to physical, magical, and elemental damage. This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration. Combined with a short casting time, these factors make the spell ideally suited for use in the thick of combat, where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death.
<br>
<br><strong>Chain Contingency</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Universal
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the wizard and releases it only under certain circumstances. Basically, the wizard chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of up to 8th level may be used in the contingency.
<br>
<br><strong>Time Stop</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop in the entire area that the caster is currently in. Outside this area, the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant, but inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for three rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between the ticks of a clock. Nothing can enter the area of effect without also being stopped in time. When 3 rounds have passed, everyone begins operating in normal time once more, and all spells that were cast during the Time Stop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.
<br>
<br><strong>Imprisonment</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Permanent
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the target creature becomes entombed in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth in a state of suspended animation, conscious of their fate. The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists: rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then they will reappear exactly where they were last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>NOTE: Due to game engine limitations, party members affected by this spell will instead be Mazed for 5 turns before being slain. This will allow you to leave the current area if necessary, and will not remove them from your party.
<br>
<br><strong>Meteor Swarm</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath half
<br>
<br>Upon completion of this spell, a swarm of minute meteors bombards the affected area, dealing devastating damage to friend and foe. Any creature caught in the destructive path of the meteors will suffer 40D4 fire damage, with a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty allowed for half damage. The caster is well advised to be careful in their use of this spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br><strong>Power Word: Kill</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>When this power word is uttered, one creature targeted by the caster is slain. Creatures who currently have 60 or more hit points can save vs. spell at a -2 penalty to avoid being slain, but those with 1 to 59 hit points are powerless to resist. Even if the target's maximum hit points are higher than 60, its current hit points are used for this determination.
<br>
<br><strong>Wail of the Banshee</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Sight
<br>Saving Throw: Death negates
<br>
<br>At the culmination of this dreadful spell, the wizard screams like a banshee (groaning spirit). Everyone within sight hears the awful cry, and opponents who fail a save vs. death at a -2 penalty die instantly while those surviving the wail are deafened for 2 rounds. The caster and their allies are immune to the effects of the wail.
<br>
<br><strong>Larloch's Energy Drain</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Necromancy
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a living creature and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane. This process drains the target of 4 levels of experience, causing them to lose THAC0, maximum hit points, memorized spells, and special abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. As the life force passes through the caster, they are temporarily invigorated, restoring 30 hit points and gaining an additional +20 bonus to maximum hit points, a +4 bonus to THAC0, a +3 bonus to saving throws, and a +20% bonus to thieving skills for five turns. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>NOTE: This may spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's abilities. However, the caster may still use the spell to heal themselves even while another instance of the spell is in effect.
<br>
<br><strong>Black Blade of Disaster</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about 5 feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The sword deals 2D12 slashing damage each hit, and there is a 15% chance the victim is disintegrated and suffers 40D6 magic damage (save vs. breath at -2 for 5D6). The caster wields the blade as if proficient and at a base THAC0 of 0, and it is considered to be of +5 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit.
<br>
<br><strong>Shapechange</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the forms of five powerful creatures: that of an iron golem, a mind flayer, a nycaloth, an elder spirit troll, or an alpha wolfwere. For the duration of the spell, the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, as many times as they wish. Physical characteristics are changed to adhere to the new form, and the caster gains their natural attacks and abilities but cannot cast spells while shapeshifted. However, the caster's mental characteristics are not affected, and nor is there a risk of changing their mental capabilities or personality. Additionally, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the caster.

<br><strong>Freedom</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, all friendly creatures in the area are freed from spells and other effects that restrict their movement or bind their minds. These effects include charm, confusion, domination, entangle, feeblemindedness, hold, paralysis, petrification, sleep, slow, stun, and web. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes. If it is cast in an area where a creature was sealed with an Imprisonment spell, it will instantly free them and they will reappear exactly where they were standing when they were imprisoned.
<br>
<br><strong>Bigby's Crushing Hand</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: Special
<br>
<br>This spell creates a huge disembodied hand that crushes a victim and knocks them senseless. Each round, the massive hand smashes the target for 2D10 crushing damage and stuns them for 1 round. A successful save vs. paralyzation at a -4 penalty reduces the damage by half and negates the stun for the given round.
<br>
<br><strong>Wish</strong>
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Universal
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Wish is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. The wiser the caster, the better chance that the right wording will be chosen. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.


<br><br><h2><a id="arcanehlas"></a>High Level Abilities</h2>

<br><strong>Energy Blades</strong>
<br>Level: Epic
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 turns
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: Special
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>An energy blade is a discus made of pure energy. The discs are thrown with a +10 bonus to THAC0, dealing 1D4 + 5 missile damage and 1D10 electrical damage, and are considered to be of +5 enchantment to determine what they can hit. This spell creates 20 energy discs and sets the caster's number of attacks per round to 10 as long as the discs are held.
<br>
<br><strong>Improved Alacrity</strong>
<br>Level: Epic
<br>School: Alteration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: Special
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>Improved Alacrity essentially erases the pause between casting spells. When cast, the wizard can begin casting a new spell the instant they are finished casting their current spell. This powerful effect lasts for only 2 rounds.
<br>
<br><strong>Dragon's Breath</strong>
<br>Level: Epic
<br>School: Evocation
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instant
<br>Casting Time: 5
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Breath partial
<br>
<br>This spell causes the disembodied head of a red dragon to appear and breathe fire with the strength of an adult red dragon. In addition to the enormous 25D6 fireball, the force of the dragon's breath knocks opponents away from the caster and leaves them unconscious for 1 round. Those affected can save vs. breath at a -2 penalty to take only half damage and not be blown backwards. This spell will not harm party members. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
<br>

<br><strong>Comet</strong>
<br>Level: Epic
<br>School: Conjuration
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: Instantaneous
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: 30' radius
<br>Saving Throw: Paralyzation partial
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, a huge meteor or comet strikes the earth, damaging all enemies in its path and sending out a powerful shockwave that knocks away all foes in the area of effect. Those caught in the impact suffer 10D10 crushing damage and must make a save vs. paralyzation at a -4 penalty or be knocked unconscious for 2 rounds. This spell will not harm party members. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

<br>
<br><strong>Blindness</strong> (instead of Obscuring Mist)
<br>Level: 1
<br>School: Illusion
<br>Range: Long
<br>Duration: 1 turn
<br>Casting Time: 2
<br>Area of Effect: 1 person
<br>Saving Throw: Spell negates
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the target is temporarily blinded for the duration of the spell. A blinded victim suffers a -10 penalty to THAC0 and decreased visibility range, but avoids all harmful effects if they successfully make a save vs. spell.
<br>

<br><strong>Minor Globe of Invulnerability</strong> (non-dispellable variant)
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by magical attacks such as Secret Word and Pierce Magic.
<br>

<br><strong>Enchanted Weapon</strong> (EE version)
<br>Level: 4
<br>School: Enchantment
<br>Range: Touch
<br>Duration: 8 hours
<br>Casting Time: 4
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast on a creature it enchants any weapons that it currently wields. For the duration of the spell, those weapons are treated as having a +3 enchantment for the purposes of determining what they can hit.
<br>

<br><strong>Globe of Invulnerability</strong> (non-dispellable variant)
<br>Level: 6
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Personal
<br>Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
<br>Casting Time: 6
<br>Area of Effect: Caster
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by magical attacks such as Ruby Ray of Reversal and Spellstrike.
<br>

<br><strong>Imprisonment</strong> (saving throw variant)
<br>Level: 9
<br>School: Abjuration
<br>Range: Short
<br>Duration: Permanent
<br>Casting Time: 1 round
<br>Area of Effect: 1 creature
<br>Saving Throw: None
<br>
<br>When this spell is cast, the target creature must save vs. spell at a -6 penalty or become entombed in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth in a state of suspended animation, conscious of their fate. The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists: rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then they will reappear exactly where they were last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
<br>
<br>NOTE: Due to game engine limitations, party members affected by this spell will instead be Mazed for 5 turns before being slain. This will allow you to leave the current area if necessary, and will not remove them from your party.
