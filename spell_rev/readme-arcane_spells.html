<br>
When the wizard casts this spell, a cone of searing flames shoots from their fingertips towards the designated point. Their hands must be held so as to send forth a fan-like sheet of flames: the wizard's thumbs must touch each other and their fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out 10-foot-long jets of flame in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the caster. All creatures caught in the flames suffer 1D6 fire damage as well an additional 1D6 fire damage for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5D6 at 9th level.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi104" name="spwi104"></a>Charm Person</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>

Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 person<br>
Saving Throw: Spell negates<br>
<br>
This spell affects any single person that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the target fails their save vs. spell at a +2 bonus, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi117" name="spwi117"></a>Chill Touch</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>

Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses their hand. This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature suffers 1D6 cold damage and an additional 1D6 cold damage for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5D6 at 9th level. The target must also save vs. death or suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0 and damage for 5 rounds. The spell expires once the caster makes a successful melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0) or after 1 turn has passed.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi118" name="spwi118"></a>Chromatic Orb</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Alteration<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Spell partial<br>
<br>
This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly towards its target, dealing magic damage and causing different effects depending upon its color. As the level of the caster improves, both the damage dealt and number of colors known increases. The color of any given orb is chosen randomly from the colors known at the wizard's level, and the orb is occasionally even multicolored, causing multiple effects. The target cannot avoid the initial damage, but can save vs. spell to negate the secondary effects.<br>
<br>
1st: White, 1D4 damage - Light, -4 penalty to saving throws<br>
3rd: Aquamarine, 1D6 damage - Magnetism, -4 penalty to AC<br>
5th: Red, 1D8 damage - Wound, 1 bleeding damage every round<br>
7th: Green, 1D10 damage - Poison, 2 poison damage every round<br>
9th: Yellow, 2D6 damage - Blindness<br>
12th: Violet, 2D8 damage - Slow<br>
14th: Blue, 2D10 damage - Paralysis</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi105" name="spwi105"></a>Color Spray</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>

<br>
Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from their hand. The spray is 20 feet in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the caster, while the effects differ depending upon the experience level of the caster and those affected. The effects are concurrent and cumulative.<br>
<br>
Target's Hit Dice - Effects of Color Spray<br>
 All enemies - Confusion for 1 round<br>
 2 more than caster - Blindness for 2 rounds<br>
 Equal to or less than caster - Slow for 5 rounds</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi126" name="spwi126"></a>Detect Alignment</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Divination<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell allows the wizard to search out the feelings of all creatures within the current area. When affected by this spell, a target will briefly glow red if they're evil, green if they're good, and white if they're neutral. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi109" name="spwi109"></a>Dimension Jump</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Conjuration<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell transports the caster to any place within sight. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, which they immediately step through. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds themselves at their chosen destination. The caster always arrives at exactly the spot desired, and the portal doesn't allow anyone or anything else to pass through. Spells about to be cast upon the wizard will fail, and missiles about to hit them will instead hit thin air.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi108" name="spwi108"></a>Expeditious Retreat</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Alteration<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When cast, this spell provides all party members in the area with amazing fleetness of foot. Their movement rate is tripled for the duration of the spell, but the excessively unnatural speed prevents them from effectively taking most other actions except for running, causing affected party members to suffer a -20 penalty to THAC0 and 100% spell failure. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi123" name="spwi123"></a>Find Familiar</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Universal<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: Permanent<br>
Casting Time: 1 round<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell enables the caster to summon a familiar to act as their aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with them, and serving as a guard, scout, and spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and they have no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all. Note that this spell may only be cast by the protagonist.<br>
<br>
The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total hit points as bonus hit points. However, the caster must take care to treat their familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster will lose the bonus hit points and half the familiar's hit points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of constitution permanently.<br>
<br>
For example, a wizard has 15 hit points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 24 hit points, so the caster gets a bonus of 12 hit points and now has 27 hit points. If the familiar dies, the caster will lose those additional 12 hit points (putting them back at 15), permanently lose 1 point of constitution (which may cause additional hit point loss), and take an additional 12 damage.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:<br>
<br>
LAWFUL GOOD: Pseudodragon<br>
NEUTRAL GOOD: Psuedodragon<br>
CHAOTIC GOOD: Fairy Dragon<br>
<br>
LAWFUL NEUTRAL: Ferret<br>
TRUE NEUTRAL: Rabbit<br>
CHAOTIC NEUTRAL: Cat<br>
<br>
LAWFUL EVIL: Imp<br>
NEUTRAL EVIL: Dust Mephit<br>
CHAOTIC EVIL: Quasit<br>
<br>
You can view your familiar's statistics from the inventory screen.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi127" name="spwi127"></a>Friends</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Enchantment<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: 5 turns<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Caster<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain a +5 bonus to charisma. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with them and make an effort to be their friends and help them, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax information; and attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking them captive instead.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi101" name="spwi101"></a>Grease</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Conjuration<br>
Range: Medium<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 10' radius<br>
Saving Throw: Breath partial<br>
<br>
This spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. breath at a +2 bonus or fall to the ground for one round. Those who enter the area or remain within it must make a saving throw each round until they reach the nearest non-greased surface. A creature that successfully makes their saving throw can walk within and through the grease but will have their movements slowed considerably. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the greasy coating.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi110" name="spwi110"></a>Identify</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Divination<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: Special<br>
Area of Effect: 1 item<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, name and enchantments (including curses) of one item subsequently touched by the wizard are revealed without fail. Many unidentified items can still be used, but at great risk.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi119" name="spwi119"></a>Larloch's Minor Drain</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Necromancy<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a creature and adds it to their own. The target suffers 2 magic damage, which  increases by 2 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 10 at 9th level. These hit points are then added to the caster's current hit points, and any hit points over the caster's normal maximum are treated as additional maximum hit points that last for 1 turn.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi102" name="spwi102"></a>Mage Armor</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Conjuration<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: 8 hours<br>
Casting Time: 1 round<br>
Area of Effect: Caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical force field that sets their base AC to 6 and improves by 1 for every four extra experience levels of the caster, up to a minimum base AC of 4 at 9th level. This spell will not function with any other form of magical body armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity and other AC bonuses. The mage armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. The armor lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi112" name="spwi112"></a>Magic Missile</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Evocation<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
One of the most popular 1st-level spells, this spell creates missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target. Each missile deals 1D4 + 1 magic damage. For every two extra experience levels of the caster, the wizard gains an additional missile, up to a maximum of five missiles at 9th level.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="spwi107" name="spwi107"></a>Monster Summoning I</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Conjuration<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: 5 turns<br>
Casting Time: 1 round<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
By means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the wizard under any and all conditions. The type and number of creatures that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.

Upon casting this spell, the wizard creates one illusory image of themselves that will travel alongside them. The image performs all of the actions that the wizard does, and there is a 50% chance that an attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that they will attack the caster. If the image is struck, then it will temporarily disappear before reappearing the next round. The image will also disappear if a dispel magic or a detect illusion spell is cast upon it. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects will not create additional images.</p></div>

When a wizard casts this spell, they cause a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures. Creatures in the area of effect must make a save vs. spell or fall asleep for the duration of the spell, though any further attempts to harm the targets will awaken them.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not successfully make a save vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the caster as possible. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead creatures, certain powerful creatures who can easily discern the illusion such as dragons, and those with no intelligence score are unaffected by this spell, as are creatures under the effects of a True Seeing spell.</p></div>

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around them such as opening doors, disarming traps, or opening chests. An invisible creature can drink a potion, or cast non-attack spells centered on themselves and remain invisible, but they cannot attack nor cast spells on other targets without ending the spell. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, the recipient attacks any creature, or the duration has expired.</p></div>

When this spell is invoked, the wizard causes a number of illusory duplicates of themselves to come into being around them. The spell creates two images plus one for every three experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level. These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects will not create additional images.</p></div>

Application of this spell sets the strength of the character to 18 and then adds 50 exceptional strength on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then their strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then their strength will become 18/50 + the original percentage. If their strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more.</p></div>

A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 20 feet in radius. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Creatures that make a save vs. breath can move at half speed through the area, but must make additional saving throws each round they remain in the area of effect. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs, unable to move for that round. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are spiders and exceptionally large and strong creatures who suffer little to no distress from the webs.</p></div>

This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with two differences: the saving throw has no bonus, and the enchantment has a longer duration. This spell affects any single person that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the target fails their save vs. spell, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.<br>

If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.</p></div>

Dispel Magic dispels the magical effects upon any creatures within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experience level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic they are trying to dispel, their chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic they attempt to dispel, their chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.</p></div>

A fireball is an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar, delivering fire damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it. The wizard points their finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless impacting upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). The fireball deals 1D6 fire damage for each level of experience of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D6 at 10th level. Creatures who save vs. breath at a -2 penalty manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, and receive only half damage from the blast.</p></div>

This spell enables the wizard to hurl flaming arrows at their enemies. The caster receives one arrow for every two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of five at 10th level. Each arrow deals 1D6 + 3 missile damage and 1D6 fire damage. Upon completion of the spell, the first arrow will streak towards the creature targeted by the caster, while additional arrows will randomly target opponents within visual range of the caster.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, the wizard creates an insubstantial but quasi-real suit of armor. This semi-illusory material covers the recipient and actually gives some real protection so long as opponents do not actively disbelieve in it by detecting the illusion. When cast, the ghostly nimbus of light surrounds the recipient, setting their base AC to 2 and granting a +20% bonus to Hide in Shadows. This spell will not function with any other form of magical body armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity and other AC bonuses. The ghost armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. The armor lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully detected or dispelled.</p></div>

<br>
This spell stops undead creatures in their place for the duration of the spell. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any undead creatures within 5 feet of the target are also affected. Those who succeed at a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
Those affected become unable move or groan, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence the effect does not stop any worsening of their condition due to injury or rot.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, all affected creatures gain a +4 bonus to their normal movement rate and receive an extra half attack per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected, though Haste negates and counters the effects of a Slow spell. Note that affected creatures expend as much energy during this spell as they would normally in a whole day, causing them to become exhausted for 2 rounds after the duration of the spell. While exhausted, the affected creatures suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, and AC. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected, though Haste negates and counters the effects of a Slow spell. This spell is not cumulative with itself or other similar magic.</p></div>

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn.

<br>
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.</p></div>

This spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 6 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 4th level spell. Spells greater than 4th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.<br>
<br>
Spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities are also absorbed, but stationary area of effect spells such as Ice Storm or Cloudkill are not.</p></div>

By casting this spell, the wizard makes the recipient undetectable by spells such as Detect Invisibility, Invisibility Purge, and True Seeing, though they may still be audible when moving and certain types of creatures may still sense their presence through other means. Furthermore, anti-illusory spells and abilities such as Detect Illusion and Oracle will also have no effect upon the recipient. This spell does not protect the recipient from detection as a result of engaging in overtly hostile actions, though it will continue to protect other types of illusions they may have active from being directly dispelled. Note, however, that specific opponents affected with anti-invisibility spells such as True Seeing will be able to target the recipient with spellcasting through improved invisibility for as long as such anti-invisibility spells are active. This spell wards the recipient's equipment as well as the creature itself.</p></div>

Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.<br>

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experience level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%.

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of their gear become insubstantial. As an incorpreal creature, the caster moves silently and cannot be heard or backstabbed, and is vulnerable only to magical attacks of +1 enchantment or better (or by creatures otherwise able to affect those vulnerable only to magical weapons). Non-damaging spell effects affect the caster normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (e.g. Polymorph Other, Flesh to Stone, Disintegrate, and Implosion) or create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (e.g. Entangle, Grease, and Web).<br>
<br>
While in wraith form, the caster also has a base AC of 4 and is immune to the effects of disease and poison, but is unable to cast spells. Any melee attack made while in wraith form is considered a melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0), while projectiles become corporeal as soon as they are fired. The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.</p></div>

This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, that enable observant opponents to approximate the invisible character's whereabouts. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for, after the creature has made their presence known. Once the character has revealed themselves, opponents can attempt to attack them with conventional weapons, though they do so with a -4 penalty to the attack roll, or they may cast area of effect spells near their position. Opponents remain unable to directly target the invisible creature with spells, scrolls, or abilities until the spell duration expires or the invisibility is dispelled.</p></div>

This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell, as well as other forms of magical attacks such as Secret Word and Pierce Magic.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature if they fail to make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage. Actually, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful dispel magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world.<br>
<br>
The caster has the option of using the spell to protect their allies. Resistances and saving throws are bypassed when the target is willing.</p></div>

This spell is a powerful incantation that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental characteristics are not affected and they do not receive any special abilities for their new form, but physical characteristics are changed to adhere to their new form and they lose any special abilities they had in their original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the target into a squirrel unless they make a save vs. polymorph. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with 1-5 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -4 penalty, those with 6-10 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -2 penalty, those with 11-15 HD/levels or more make their saving throw with no penalty, and those who with more than 15 HD/levels make their saving throw at a +2 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent, or until dispelled.<br>
<br>
Note that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once they die or the effects are dispelled.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the forms of six creatures: that of a mustard jelly, an ogre mage, a salamander, a sword spider, a troll, or a winter wolf. For the duration of the spell, the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, as many times as they wish. Physical characteristics are altered to that of the new form, and the caster gains their natural attacks but cannot cast spells while shapeshifted. However, the caster's mental characteristics are not affected, and nor is there a risk of changing their mental capabilities or personality. Additionally, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the caster.<br>

When a Secret Word spell is uttered, it will dispel one spell protection of 7th level or lower on the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first.

This spell taps the recipient's life force to create a corporeal barrier around their body. When cast, the recipient's AC is set to 0, and saving throws vs. death will be made with a +3 bonus. There is a danger in using this spell, however, as the external portion of the target's spirit is temporarily lost when the spell duration expires, dealing 1D6 damage to the recipient unless they successfully save vs. spell. This spell will not function with any other form of magical body armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity and other AC bonuses. The spirit armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. The armor lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.</p></div>

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon themselves, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding them. and its purpose is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two experience levels of the caster, and for each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack. For example, a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against them, but the sixth would affect them normally. The skins will remain on the caster for the duration of the spell, until all of the skins are destroyed by physical attacks, or until they are affected by a dispel magic.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any area of effect attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of dealing some type of elemental damage will still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.</p></div>

With this spell, the wizard instigates a teleportation effect as far as they can see. All enemies in this area are randomly teleported for the duration of the spell unless they make a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty.

When this spell is cast, a glowing orb of emerald acid streaks towards the target and explodes, drenching everyone within a 10' radius in potent acid. Each creature in the area immediately suffers 1D4 acid damage for each level of experience of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. After the initial round, those covered in the sphere's acid continue to suffer two less dice of acid damage in the following rounds. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8D4 damage with this spell in the first round, 6D4 in the second round, 4D4 in the third round, and 2D4 in the fourth round. During each round except the first, those affected can make a save vs. breath at a -2 penalty to reduce that round's damage by half and avoid further damage in any remaining rounds.</p></div>

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends them visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas and can travel in any direction for as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility, for example), and so solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel cast on the caster or eye ends the spell.</p></div>

This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly, yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4 hit dice, while creatures with 4 to 6 hit dice must save vs. poison at a -4 penalty to avoid being slain. Those with more than 6 hit dice must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1D10 poison damage each round while in the area of effect.

This spell holds creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed at making a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.<br>
<br>
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.</p></div>

When cast upon a creature, this spell will lower their magic resistance by 2% for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 50% at 25th level. There is no saving throw against this spell and magic resistance is ignored. This spell is not affected by dispel magic, so once it has been cast, there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.<br>
<br>
For example, if a creature has 50% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th level wizard, then its magic resistance would be lowered to 20%. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell. If this spell was cast upon this same creature again, the creature's magic resistance would be 50% - 30% (initial casting) - 30% (current casting), which would leave the creature with 0% magic resistance after both spells have been cast.</p></div>

This spell conjures a boiling acid barrier around the wizard. The shield grants the caster 50% acid resistance and opponents that hit them with a weapon or spell from within a 10' radius will suffer 2D4 + 1/two levels acid damage, up to a maximum of 2D4 + 10 at 20th level. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative, but it can be used in conjunction with other similar spells. Tiny insects cannot pass through the acid sheath.

This spell creates a translucent, weightless, and shadow-like sword made of material from the Plane of Shadow that extends 3 feet from the caster's hand. The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and it is considered to be of +4 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit. The sword deals 1D12 + 4 magic damage to its victims, and an additional 10 damage is dealt against undead creatures. Furthermore, a successful hit temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail (save vs. spell at -4 neg.). Due to its ethereal nature, strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the shadow blade are considered melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The phantom blade can only be used by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.</p></div>

By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality, they have darted aside and can flee, totally invisible, for the duration of the spell. Opponents within 5 feet of the caster must save vs. spell or be fooled into following the caster through the door, becoming trapped in an extradimensional room for up to 5 rounds. Creatures with exceptional intelligence may escape the illusion faster, while creatures who can see through illusions (e.g. dragons, liches, demons), or who are under the effects of a True Seeing spell, are unaffected.</p></div>

This spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 9 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 7th level spell. Spells greater than 7th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.<br>

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from the caster's fingertips. Unlike Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies within range, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1D6 damage for every experience level of the caster to the primary target (up to a maximum of 20D6) and 1D6 for every two levels to subsequent targets (up to a maximum of 10D6). Those who make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty manage to partially avoid direct impact from the lightning and hence receive only half damage.</p></div>

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of their repertoire of known spells. The spell level must be lower or equal to the experience level of the caster divided by three. Once the spell is chosen, the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of their maximum hit points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically. For example, a 12th level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of their maximum hit points'. Then once the wizard is reduced to 50% or less of their total hit points in combat, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon them. This requires no action by the caster, happening automatically and instantaneously. The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, the spell stored cannot be an offensive spell nor can it target any other party members.</p></div>

This incantation is a powerful magic that permanently turns the flesh of the target into stone. When struck by this spell, the affected creature is slowed for 2 rounds as their flesh begins to harden, after which they must make a save vs. petrification at a -4 penalty or be turned into a statue. A dispel magic spell may avert petrification while the creature is merely slowed, but cannot restore the victim's natural form after having already been turned to stone. However, some powerful spells (such as Stone to Flesh or Freedom) may restore the target to flesh and blood. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or incorporeal creatures.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, all affected creatures gain a +4 bonus to their normal movement rate and receive an extra attack per round, as well as a +2 bonus to THAC0 and AC and a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. breath. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected, though Improved Haste negates and counters the effects of a Slow spell. Unlike the third level arcane spell Haste, there is no period of exhaustion following the expiration of the spell, and this haste spell cannot be countered by Slow. This spell is not cumulative with itself or other similar magic.</p></div>

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This creature obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 8 hours or until it is killed, at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.<br>

When this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from their original position. Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where they used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster. The illusory double vanishes after the duration of the spell and cannot perform any actions at all, like attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible wizard. As long as the image isn't destroyed, the caster can attack and cast spells while remaining completely hidden. The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys the illusion.</p></div>

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Magic are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, and Mind Blank.</p></div>

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by magical weapons; all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere, then immediately fall to the ground). This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted as well as attacks of especially powerful monsters. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.</p></div>

By casting this spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, a nishruu. At first glance, this creature appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, the churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to a flame, the nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Nishruus do not use physical attacks: instead, each time a nishruu touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from them. Except for a dispel magic or Banishment, the nishruu is completely immune to magic, and magic will actually heal the nishruu. The creature will remain under the caster's control for the duration of the spell or until slain.<br>

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. For when the wizard casts the spell, they undergo a startling transformation which alters their body and mind into that of a warrior. The wizard gains 2 hit points per caster level (up to a maximum of 40), and all damage they sustain comes first from the magical points gained. The AC of the caster is 4 better than they possessed prior casting the spell, and all attacks are made with the THAC0 of a fighter of the same level as the caster. The wizard gains extra attacks as a fighter of the same level, thus an extra half attack per round at 7th level and another half attack per round at 13th level. Furthermore, each attack is made at a +2 bonus, each successful hit in combat deals +2 damage, and saving throws against death/poison are made by the caster with a +5 bonus, but casting speed is penalized by 2 and saving throws against spell are made by the caster with a -3 penalty. The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/mages if they have already received them as a part of their class, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter experience levels.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, the wizard gains the ability to see the exact locations of creatures or objects under displacement or invisibility effects, as well as see through illusions. Instantly and at the end of each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all concealed enemies within sight of the caster will become visible to the caster and their allies, and minor illusionary spells (including Reflected Image, Blur, and Mirror Image) cast by opponents will be neutralized outright. Creatures affected by improved invisibility will be revealed to the party, but can only be directly targetable with spellcasting by the caster of this spell. Finally, the caster is also cured of and granted immunity to blindness as well as hostile illusion spells such as Spook and Shadow Door for the duration of the spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
NOTE: True Seeing does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by Mislead or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions.</p></div>

There is no saving throw if the undead creature has 5 or more hit dice less than the caster, otherwise a save vs. spell at a -4 penalty is allowed to negate the effect.

This spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 12 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell.

Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points lost in battle. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Lastly, the wiser the caster, the better chance that they will choose the right wording. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.</p></div>

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Priests are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity.<br>

By casting this spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, a hakeashar. The hakeashar is a more powerful version of the nishruu. At first glance, this creature appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, the churning grey mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to a flame, the nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Nishruus do not use physical attacks: instead, each time a nishruu touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from them. Except for a dispel magic or Banishment, the nishruu is completely immune to magic, and magic will actually heal the nishruu. The creature will remain under the caster's control for the duration of the spell or until slain.<br>

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of their gear assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost. As an incorpreal creature, the caster moves silently and cannot be heard or backstabbed, and is vulnerable only to magical attacks of +1 enchantment or better (or by creatures otherwise able to affect those vulnerable only to magical weapons). Even when hit by magical attacks, any physical damage sustained while in ghost form is reduced by 50%. Non-damaging spell effects affect the caster normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (e.g. Polymorph Other, Flesh to Stone, Disintegrate, and Implosion) or create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (e.g. Entangle, Grease, and Web).<br>
<br>
While in ghost form, the caster also has a base AC of 0 and is immune to the effects of disease and poison. Any melee attack made while in ghost form is considered a melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0), while projectiles become corporeal as soon as they are fired. The transformation lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.</p></div>

A save vs. breath at a -4 penalty reduces the damage by half. Fire dwellers like fire elementals, fire giants, and salamanders are immune to the effects of this spell.</p></div>

The caster wields the blade as if proficient and at a base THAC0 of 0, and it is considered to be of +5 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit.</p></div>

Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the wizard and releases it only under certain circumstances. Basically, the wizard chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of up to 8th level may be used in the contingency.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, all friendly creatures in the area are freed from spells and other effects that restrict their movement or bind their minds. These effects include charm, confusion, domination, entangle, feeblemindedness, hold, paralysis, petrification, sleep, slow, stun, and web. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes. If it is cast in an area where a creature was sealed with an Imprisonment spell, it will instantly free them and they will reappear exactly where they were standing when they were imprisoned.</p></div>

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Pit Fiend, the most powerful specimen of the Baatezu. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Wizards are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Pit Fiend will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity, tear them and their allies apart piece by piece and then feast on the remains.<br>

When this spell is cast, the target creature becomes entombed in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth in a state of suspended animation, conscious of their fate. The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists: rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then they will reappear exactly where they were last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Due to game engine limitations, party members affected by this spell will instead be Mazed for 5 turns before being slain. This will allow you to leave the current area if necessary, and will not remove them from your party.</p></div>

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a living creature and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane. This process drains the target of 4 levels of experience, causing them to lose THAC0, maximum hit points, memorized spells, and special abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. As the life force passes through the caster, they are temporarily invigorated, restoring 30 hit points and gaining an additional +20 bonus to maximum hit points, a +4 bonus to THAC0, a +3 bonus to saving throws, and a +20% bonus to thieving skills for five turns. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This may spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's abilities. However, the caster may still use the spell to heal themselves even while another instance of the spell is in effect.</p></div>

With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the forms of five powerful creatures: that of an iron golem, a mind flayer, a nycaloth, an elder spirit troll, or an alpha wolfwere. For the duration of the spell, the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, as many times as they wish. Physical characteristics are changed to adhere to the new form, and the caster gains their natural attacks and abilities but cannot cast spells while shapeshifted. However, the caster's mental characteristics are not affected, and nor is there a risk of changing their mental capabilities or personality. Additionally, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the caster.<br>

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop in the entire area that the caster is currently in. Outside this area, the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant, but inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for three rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between the ticks of a clock. Nothing can enter the area of effect without also being stopped in time. When 3 rounds have passed, everyone begins operating in normal time once more, and all spells that were cast during the Time Stop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.</p></div>

Wish is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. The wiser the caster, the better chance that the right wording will be chosen. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.</p></div>

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by magical attacks such as Ruby Ray of Reversal and Spellstrike.</p></div>

Range: Short<br>
Duration: Permanent<br>
Casting Time: 1 round<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, the target creature must save vs. spell at a -6 penalty or become entombed in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth in a state of suspended animation, conscious of their fate. The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists: rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then they will reappear exactly where they were last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.</p></div>
