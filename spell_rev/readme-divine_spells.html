Sphere: Protection<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: 5 turns<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
The caster of the Armor of Faith spell receives significant protection against physical and magic damage. This magical armor is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster, effectively reducing damage sustained by 10%. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr101" name="sppr101"></a>Bless</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>

Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Upon uttering the Bless spell, the priest grants a +1 bonus to THAC0, damage, and morale to friendly creatures. The caster determines at what range they will cast the spell, and the instant the spell is completed, it affects all eligible creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr121" name="sppr121"></a>Cause Light Wounds</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>

Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>

This spell is the reverse of Cure Light Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes injuries. On a successful touch from the priest, the target suffers 1D10 + 1/level magic damage, up to a maximum of 1D10 + 10 at 10th level. The spell expires once the priest makes a successful melee touch attack (+4 bonus to THAC0) or after 1 turn has passed. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr102" name="sppr102"></a>Command</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>

This spell enables the priest to command another creature to lie down and take no action (sleep) for a single round. The target has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr103" name="sppr103"></a>Cure Light Wounds</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>

<p><h3><a id="sppr104" name="sppr104"></a>Detect Alignment</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Divination<br>
Sphere: Divination<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell allows the priest to search out the feelings of all creatures within the current area. When affected by this spell, a target will briefly glow red if they're evil, green if they're good, and white if they're neutral. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr113" name="sppr113"></a>Doom</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Enchantment<br>
Sphere: Charm<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Spell negates<br>
<br>
This spell causes a feeling of doom to overwhelm the target. For the duration of the spell, the target suffers a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, and saving throws. The creature may make a save vs. spell at a penalty of -1 for every two extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr105" name="sppr105"></a>Entangle</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Alteration<br>
Sphere: Plant<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 30' radius<br>
Saving Throw: Breath partial<br>
<br>
By means of this spell, the caster causes plants to spring up from the ground and entangle all creatures in the area of effect. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in the area, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Those held receive a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Creatures that make a save vs. breath temporarily avoid entanglement and can move at half their normal movement rate through the area, but must make an additional saving throw each round that they remain in the area of effect. An entangled creature can attack, provided it does not have to move to reach an opponent. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large and strong creatures who suffer little to no distress from the entangling plants.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr116" name="sppr116"></a>Faerie Fire</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Evocation<br>
Sphere: Weather<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 20' radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all enemies within the area of effect, making their position and movements easily visible. Invisible creatures are revealed, and those who do not successfully make a saving throw vs. spell are distinctly outlined for the next 5 rounds. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by stealth, invisibility, or similar effects, and suffer a -2 penalty to AC. The faerie fire light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light, and does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr120" name="sppr120"></a>Goodberry</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Alteration<br>
Sphere: Plant<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 1 round<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Casting a Goodberry spell creates 3 magical berries that the caster can carry with them or give to others. When consumed, these berries restore 5 hit points and one additional hit point for every three experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 10 at 15th level. The berries last for 24 hours or until eaten.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr106" name="sppr106"></a>Magical Stone</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Enchantment<br>
Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant ten small stones, no larger than sling bullets. When thrown, each stone deals 1D4 + 2 missile damage (1D4 + 5 against undead) upon a successful hit, and the caster can hurl up to three stones per round. The caster wields them as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and they are considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what they can hit. The stones can be used only by the caster, and remain in their hand for 5 turns or until used.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr123" name="sppr123"></a>Obscuring Mist</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Conjuration<br>
Sphere: Weather<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 20' radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, a misty bank of fog billows out from the designated point, obscuring all sight. Everyone within the cloud suffers a -2 penalty to THAC0 while their visibility range is reduced by half, and anyone inside or outside the cloud trying to attack a creature concealed by the fog with ranged weapons will do so with a -4 penalty to THAC0. Creatures that do not rely on sight can fight within the cloud without penalties.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr107" name="sppr107"></a>Protection from Evil</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Abjuration<br>
Sphere: Protection<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: 5 turns<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: first, all attacks made by evil creatures against the protected creature receive a -2 penalty to their THAC0, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus. Multiple castings of this spell or similar effects are not cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr119" name="sppr119"></a>Regenerate Light Wounds</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Alteration<br>
Sphere: Healing<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell enables the caster to mend the wounds and injuries of the target by granting them temporary regeneration. The affected creature will regenerate 15 + 1.5/two levels hit points over the duration of the spell, up to a maximum of 30 at 20th level.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr108" name="sppr108"></a>Resist Fear</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Abjuration<br>
Sphere: Charm<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: 5 turns<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 30' radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
The priest instills courage in allies, raising their morale to its highest. If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated, and they are protected from it for the duration of the spell. The instant the spell is completed, it affects all eligible creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr109" name="sppr109"></a>Sanctuary</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Abjuration<br>
Sphere: Charm, Protection<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all opponents to ignore their existence, as if they were invisible. While protected by this spell, the priest cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells focused on themselves or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal their wounds, for example, or to cast a Chant spell, but they cannot cast spells on other targets without ending the spell.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr110" name="sppr110"></a>Shillelagh</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Alteration<br>
Sphere: Combat, Plant<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell enables the caster to create a magical cudgel. Dealing 2D4 + 1 crushing damage upon a successful hit, this shillelagh also causes tendrils to wrap around and hold the victim in place for 1 round unless they successfully make a save vs. breath. The caster wields the shillelagh as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and it is considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit. This enchantment level increases by one for every four extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 9th level. Strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the shillelagh are considered to be melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The shillelagh can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr117" name="sppr117"></a>Strength of Stone</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Alteration<br>
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)<br>
Range: Personal<br>
Duration: 5 turns<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: Caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Calling upon the strength of the earth, the caster gains some of the solidity and strength of stone, setting their strength to 18 and adding an additional +50 exceptional strength on top of this, and they receive any Strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 Strength, then their Strength will just be set to 18/00, while if a character has a Strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then their Strength will become 18/50 + the original percentage. If their Strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's Strength if it is already 19 or more. For the duration of the spell, the caster also becomes immune to everything, magical or otherwise, that pushes them away, such as wing buffets, telekinesis, Gust of Wind, and Battering Ram.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="sppr118" name="sppr118"></a>Sunscorch</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Level: 1<br>
School: Evocation<br>
Sphere: Sun<br>
Range: Long<br>
Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Breath partial<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, a brilliant ray of scorching heat slants down from the sky and strikes a creature chosen by the caster. The target struck by the ray is blinded for 1 round and suffers 1D6 + 1/level fire damage, up to a maximum of 1D6 + 10 at 10th level.

This spell is the reverse of Cure Medium Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes injuries. On a successful touch from the priest, the target suffers 2D10 + 2/level magic damage, up to a maximum of 2D10 + 20 at 10th level.

Area of Effect: 1 person or animal<br>
Saving Throw: Spell negates<br>
<br>
This spell affects any single person or animal that it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the target fails their save vs. spell, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
Creatures that are currently neutral to the caster are more amenable to helping them and make their saving throw with no bonus, while those that are hostile are significantly more difficult to influence and instead gain a +4 bonus to making their saving throw. If the caster attempts to harm the charmed creature, the spell is broken and the affected creature will immediately become hostile to the caster. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the affected creature resumes their previous behavior prior to being charmed.</p></div>

When a priest casts a Find Traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to them. Once per round, all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can create a sudden or unexpected result, the caster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus, "traps" include glyphs and similar spells and devices.</p></div>

This powerful trap harms those who enter, pass, or open the selected area or object. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any enemy violating the warded area will trigger the trap.<br>
<br>
When the spell is cast, the druid weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the trap, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The trap deals 1D4 fire damage per experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. breath will receive only half damage.

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from their hand, dealing 2D6 + 1 fire damage upon a successful hit. The caster wields this blade-like ray as if proficient with the weapon and at their normal base THAC0, and it is considered to be of +1 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what it can hit. This enchantment level increases by one for every three extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 9th level. Since the blade is immaterial, Strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the flame blade are considered to be melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The flame blade can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.</p></div>

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for 1 turn. The effect is centered on the target selected by the caster, and every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Creatures who make a save vs. spell are totally unaffected by the spell. The undead cannot be held with this spell.<br>
<br>
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.</p></div>

When a Know Opponent spell is cast, the priest's eyes glow with magical energy, enabling them to read the aura of the target and determine their strengths and weaknesses. For the duration of the spell, the target's physical resistances are lowered by 10% and all attacks against them are made with a +2 bonus to THAC0. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Opponent spell, and the spell has no effect on creatures who don't emanate auras, such as constructs.

By calling upon their deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. For as long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it can be used to strike at any opponents within 20 feet, dealing 1D8 + 1 magic damage upon a successful hit. The caster wields the spiritual hammer as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and it functions as a magical weapon with an enchantment bonus of +1 (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses). Starting at level 5, this enchantment level increases by one for every five extra experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +5 at 25th level. Due to its ethereal nature, Strength modifiers do not apply to THAC0 or damage, and attacks with the spiritual weapon are considered to be melee touch attacks (+4 bonus to THAC0). The spiritual hammer can be used only by the caster, and remains in their hand for the duration of the spell.</p></div>

Dispel Magic dispels the magical effects upon any creatures within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the experience level of the caster and the experience level of the caster whose magic is being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the caster whose magic they are trying to dispel, their chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the caster whose magic they are attempting to dispel, their chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.</p></div>

A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any enemy violating the warded area will trigger the trap.<br>
<br>
When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The glyph deals 1D4 electrical damage per experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 10D4 at 10th level. Those who make a save vs. breath will receive only half damage. This spell will not harm party members.</p></div>

This spell holds persons and animals rigidly immobile and in place. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. The effect is centered on the target selected by the caster, and every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Creatures who make a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.<br>
<br>
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.</p></div>

This spell causes confusion to the target, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The victim must save vs. spell or either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures tend to move as far from the caster as possible, but any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to their basic nature. The target has a saving throw penalty of -2, and there is an additional -1 for every extra two experience levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 9th level.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the target by a force or monster, and also attempts to restore any drained statistics.

While mentally dominated, the priest is simply able to command the target to perform certain tasks or functions for the duration of the spell, though the priest must be within visual range to be able to give them commands.

If the caster attempts to harm the dominated creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. Dominated creatures are unaffected by charm, and if two or more domination effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent domination takes precedence.</p></div>

Saving Throw: Polymorph negates<br>
<br>
The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. The target's mental characteristics are not affected and they do not receive any special abilities for their new form, but physical characteristics are changed to adhere to their new form and they lose any special abilities they had in their original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the target into a squirrel unless they make a save vs. polymorph. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with 1-5 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -4 penalty, those with 6-10 HD/levels make their saving throw at a -2 penalty, those with 11-15 HD/levels or more make their saving throw with no penalty, and those who with more than 15 HD/levels make their saving throw at a +2 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent, or until dispelled.<br>
<br>
Note that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once they die or the effects are dispelled.</p></div>

When a druid casts this powerful spell upon themselves, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding them. and its purpose is to protect the mage from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two experience levels of the caster, and for each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack. For example, a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against them, but the sixth would affect them normally. The skins will remain on the druid for the duration of the spell, until all of the skins are destroyed by physical attacks, or until they are affected by a dispel magic.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area of effect attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of dealing some type of elemental damage will still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked.

Dolorous Decay is a rotting and withering of the body that affects a single living creature. This disease quickly spreads throughout the body and cripples the victim, causing them to suffer a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma instantly as well as every other round after for 1 turn, during which they will be stricken with a terrible sluggishness. The target must also make a save vs. poison at a -4 penalty or suffer 1 poison damage every second for the duration of the spell. The characteristic points lost from this spell can only be restored with a Cure Disease, Heal, or Greater Restoration spell. Magic resistance does not affect this spell, though the undead and certain other creatures such as constructs, elementals, and illusions are completely immune to disease.</p></div>

The caster wields them as if proficient and at their normal base THAC0, and they are considered to be of +4 enchantment (with appropriate THAC0 and damage bonuses) to determine what they can hit.

This spell is the reverse of Heal.  Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage.  On a successful touch from the priest, the spell reduces the target to 1 hit point.

This spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the form of an invisible disk that protects the caster but also distorts their appearance as if a mirrored image of the caster traveled alongside them. Any missile attack that intersects the disk is instantly deflected, while there is a 50% chance that melee attackers will attack the mirrored image instead of the caster.

Furhermore, creatures in the area of effect continue to burn after the initial blast, suffering an additional 1D6 fire damage every round for 1 turn.

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, they call forth a horde of venomous, biting, and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, first attacking the target and then spreading to all other enemies within 30 feet of the target.<br>
<br>
For the duration of the spell, the affected creatures fight with a -2 penalty to THAC0 and AC. Every round, they must also make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty or suffer 100% chance of spell failure and 8D2 piercing damage from insect bites. A successful saving throw allows those affected to avoid most of the swarm and receive only half damage while completely negating the spell failure.

When this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips through the ground. There are a total of three tremors that are caused by the earthquake, which are staggered and occur once per round starting immediately upon the completion of the spell. The eartquake affects everyone (except earth elementals and flying creatures) in the area of affect, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.<br>
<br>
The first tremor causes all creatures to fall to the ground for 2 rounds and suffer 6D6 crushing damage, but those who successfully save vs. death at a -6 penalty will receive only half damage and avoid falling down. The second tremor is less severe than the first, but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth. Creatures in the area of effect suffer 4D6 crushing damage (a successful save vs. death at a -4 penalty reduces it by half), and they also have a 25% chance of stepping and falling into a fissure, and must successfully make a save vs. breath at a -4 penalty or die. The final tremor is the least severe of the three, and creatures suffer 2D6 crushing damage (a successful save vs. death at a -2 penalty reduces it by half). During this final tremor, there is also a 10% chance of falling and becoming trapped within a fissure, and creatures must save vs. breath at a -2 penalty or die. Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.</p></div>

This spell removes most temporary and permanent negative effects from the target creature. It reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature caused by any force, spell, or monster. It can restore a polymorphed or petrified creature to its natural form, break the effects of a curse, reverse unnatural mental states such as confusion, feeblemindedness, and berserk rages, and free the recipient from magical effects like fear, paralysis, sleep, and stun. This potent spell will also restore any lost hit points, cure the target of any diseases or poisons, and attempt to restore any drained statistics.<br>
<br>
The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, leaving them physically and mentally exhausted. For 5 rounds after the spell is cast, the priest will suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0, damage, AC, and casting speed.</p></div>

When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation. The caster becomes the very ideal of beauty - for a male, this is usually a nymph or a dryad, while for a female, the image varies. The transformation is instantaneous, but lasts only seconds, and any person (excluding party members) viewing the illusion must save vs. spell at a -4 penalty or be charmed for 1 turn. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, kobolds, and others. If the affected creatures fail their saving throws, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for the duration of the spell. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed creatures will carry them out as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
If the caster attempts to harm a charmed creature, or if a dispel magic is successfully cast upon them, the spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. After the duration of the spell, the affected creatures resume their previous behavior prior to being charmed.</p></div>

This powerful abjuration spell causes spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 99 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic, but it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.<br>
<br>
Spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities are also absorbed, but stationary area of effect spells such as Ice Storm or Cloudkill are not.</p></div>

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack their foes and themselves if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for them for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Priests are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on their summoner at the first available opportunity.<br>

When this spell is cast, it causes a ray of sunlight to beam down upon the caster and a globe of searing radiance to explode in a 30 foot radius. All hostile creatures in the area of effect are blinded for 1 turn. Living creatures suffer 10D6 fire damage, while undead creatures caught within the sunburst instead suffer 1D6 fire damage for every experience level of the caster, up to a maximum of 20D6 at 20th level. A successful save vs. breath at a -4 penalty negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half. The burst also results in the destruction of all undead creatures specifically averse to bright light (such as vampires, shadows, and wraiths) that fail a save vs. spell at a -2 penalty. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.</p></div>

This spell causes the caster to be enveloped by an aura of intense flame that both injures opponents and protects the caster from damage. This shield not only grants the caster 100% fire resistance and protects them from all non-magical weapons, but can also damage creatures within a 10 foot radius and enflame weapons held by the caster. Opponents that hit the caster with a weapon or spell from within this radius will suffer 1D8 + 10 fire damage, and whenever the caster strikes an opponent with a melee weapon, they deal an additional 1D8 fire damage. Insect swarms cannot pass through the aura. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.</p></div>
