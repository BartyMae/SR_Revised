<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  Spell Revisions aims to fix, tweak, and enhance arcane and divine spells in Baldur's Gate II, Tutu, and Baldur's Gate Trilogy. This originally started as a project to make the spell system more balanced by improving weaker spells and nerfing overpowered ones, but has evolved to also include changes to spells designed to make them more fun and interesting as well as fixes for spell-related bugs found in the original game.
  </p>
  <p>
  The mod places a high priority on making all of the existing spells viable choices, while keeping an eye on balance issues. Now Magic Missile won't be the only first-level arcane spell you'll want to memorize! To help achieve this goal, portions of the old spell system that were consistently underpowered, like healing spells and summons, have been vastly improved so that they are competitive options once more. In addition, <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> takes the stance that low-level spells should not become completely ineffective once characters reach higher levels, and adds scaling features to many spells.
  </p>
  <p>
  Among other things, the mod makes druid and cleric spell selections more distinct, with druids focusing on animal and elemental spheres for a repertoire of spells offensively-oriented. Arcane spell schools have also been fleshed out, with the belief that each spell level should contain at least one spell from each school. To help fulfill these goals, <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> adds a small number of spells to the game and modifies the schools and restrictions of some existing spells where appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
  <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> also improves the descriptions of many spells to be more accurate, more consistent, and (occasionally) less boring.
  </p>
  <p>
  Complete spell descriptions can be found <a href="#spell_changes">here</a>. I know that not everyone will like all of the changes made - and some of them are controversial - but this can be discussed and suggestions are welcome. If you think that your favorite spell has become complete rubbish, you can choose spells that should be left unmodified before starting the installation process. See the Power Users section below to learn how.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  If bugs are discovered in the current version of the mod, they are usually corrected in the latest github repository. Before installing SRR, check <a href="https://github.com/BartyMae/SR_Revised">here</a> and download the latest version via the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP".
  </p>
  <p>
  To install this, you must extract the latest official version of SR (V4 b18, or have an automated tool do it for you) to your game directory as per normal, and then additionally extract this mod on top of it before installing SR. Specifically, SR's spell_rev folder should overwrite the normal spell_rev folder - confirm to overwrite folders as well as all files it asks you to. Make sure to look at your settings.ini in your spell_rev directory! There are a number of different customization options in there that you will likely be interested in and possibly want to change in order to get the most out of this mod - see the optional settings.ini tweaks section below for explanations of each one.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  This mod has been designed to work with original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal">BG2:ToB</acronym> installations. It has not been extensively tested solely with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn">BG2:SoA</acronym>, but there are no problems anticipated if the expansion is not installed. The mod has also been tested and should be completely compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>, Tutu, and Enhanced Edition games. A proper install order, such as listed below, should be followed to attain maximum compatibility between different mods.
  </p>
  <p>
  Spell Revisions should also work fine with most other <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and non-<acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods (it has been tested with most of them). Small problems may arise if you've installed other spell-modifying mods before <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym>. Spell Revisions will overwrite changes made by these mods (although new spells introduced by them probably won't be affected). To prevent this, you may wish to disable specific changes made by this mod. Read the section below for details on how to do this. You shouldn't need to start a new game to take advantage of this mod, but doing so will ensure that divine spellbooks of party members are properly updated.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Install Order</strong><br />
  Spell Revisions has been designed with Item Revisions, Sword Coast Stratagems, and 1pp in mind. 1pp is a mod by Erephine that was fully integrated into the Enhanced Editions (and thus EE users do not need to install it) that fix numerous visual inconsistencies, improve bad graphics, tweak and add new graphics, etc. for BG2:ToB games - if you are not playing an Enhanced Edition game, it is highly recommended that you install 1pp to take full advantage of its changes. The general install order is to first install everything you want of 1pp except for the avatar-switching component, then the main component of IR/R, and finally the main component of SR/R. The avatar/armor-switching script of 1pp (or Anthology Tweaks) should not be installed until later in the install after all item-adding/modifying mods, including IR, have already been installed - after SCS/atweaks/Infinity Animations is my suggestion). Once again, Enhanced Edition players do not need to worry about 1pp - it's already integrated into your game and doesn't need installation.
  <br /><br />
  Your general install order (excluding ToBEx/BG2 Fixpack/1pp/BGT if you're playing an Enhanced Edition game) should look something like this:
  <ul>
  1. ToBEx<br />
  2. BG2 Fixpack<br />
  3. Baldur's Gate Trilogy<br />
  4. Ascension<br />
  5. BG1UB (and other BG1 content mods)<br />
  6. Unfinished Business<br />
  7. Quest Pack (and other BG2 content mods)<br />
  8. Rogue Rebalancing<br />
  9. 1pp (EXCEPT for the "Smart Avatar & Armour Switching" component)<br />
  10. Item Revisions (main component)<br />
  11. Spell Revisions (main component)<br />
  12. Infinity Animations (main component)<br />
  13. Spell Revisions (secondary components - key here is to be before SCS if you're using it)<br />
  14. Item Revisions (secondary components - key here is to be before EET_END if you're using it)<br />
  15. Anthology Tweaks<br />
  16. Sword Coast Stratagems<br />
  17. atweaks<br />
  18. polytweak<br />
  19. Infinity Animations (secondary components)<br />
  20. 1pp/Anthology Tweaks ("Smart Avatar & Armour Switching" component / "Avatar Morphing Script")
  </ul>
  You may not be using all of these, and will undoubtedly be using more besides that, but this should give you the general idea of what your install order should look like. Don't install the secondary components of IR/R and SR/R until much later in your install, after most item/spell/NPC-adding mods have been installed. A good place for the secondary components of both IR/R and SR/R is right before SCS and Anthology Tweaks to make sure that SCS spellcasters are using the correct versions of spells and to make sure that Anthology Tweaks's item tweaks don't interfere with IR's secondary components. If you're using an automated tool to install your mods on a non-EE game, the very least you should see is that the general install order is 1pp-IR-SR.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Divine Remix</strong>
  <br />
  Spell Revisions may have some compatibility issues with Divine Remix, so it is not recommended to use them together at this time. Currently, installing <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> after Divine Remix will result in divine spells no longer following the sphere system while installing Divine Remix after <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> will result in the replacement of some of <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym>'s spell descriptions and the disappearance of some of <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym>'s new and moved spells.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>gMinion</strong>
  <br />
  Spell Revisions is somewhat incompatible with the gMinion mod as it is based upon vanilla's creatures, while <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym>'s are heavily changed. <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> provides custom scripts for its creatures heavily inspired by gMinion itself. Installing gMinion before <acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> should enable its scripts for non-<acronym title="Spell Revisions">SR</acronym> creatures, but I haven't tested it.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  <strong>Windows</strong>
  <br />
  Spell Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. Alternatively, the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> or a similar program (e.g. WinZip, 7-Zip). If properly extracted, you should have an spell_rev folder and setup-spell_rev.exe in your game directory. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. To install, simply double-click setup-spell_rev.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
  <br /><br />
  Please run <strong>setup-spell_rev.exe</strong> in your game directory to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Mac OS X</strong>
  <br />
  <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> Spell Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>/Tutu folder. If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>"spell_rev"</strong> folder, <strong>setup-spell_rev</strong>, and <strong>setup-spell_rev.command</strong> in your game directory. To install, double-click <strong>setup-spell_rev.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Linux</strong>
  <br />
  Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
  <br /><br />
  Run <strong>WeInstall spell_rev</strong> in your game directory to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Components</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  <strong>Spell Revisions</strong>
  <br />
  This is the main component, containing all divine and arcane spell changes. Also included in this are some minor fixes, new animations from Icewind Dale for some illusion spells, items used by the improved creatures summoned by various spells, and innate abilities for many summoned creatures. More information on this component can be found in the section below this one, while complete spell descriptions can be found <a href="#spell_changes">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Deva and Planetar Avatars</strong> (<em>may be used with or without the main component</em>)
  <br />
  This component updates the avatars of the celestials summoned by <acronym title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> to take advantage of <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> Attachable Wings as seen <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/portraits/displayimage.php?pos=-490">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Mirror Image Fix</strong> (<em>may be used with or without the main component</em>)
  <br />
  This patch fixes mirror images so they no longer protect from AoE spells such as Fireball. Previously, such spells would likely not damage targets with Mirror Image and would instead only destroy a single mirror image - with this component, no mirror images will be destroyed and such spells will simply pass through the effect entirely.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Dispel Magic Fix</strong> (<em>may be used with or without the main component</em>)
  <br />
  This patch fixes the chance to dispel magic to match the spell's description (so there is at least a marginal chance of dispelling effects of a higher-level mage) and corrects conceptual problems caused by the automatic dispelling of all magically created items. More info about its outrageous old behaviour can be found <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/17799-does-dispel-magic-work-properly/">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Cure Sleep Fix</strong> (<em>requires the main component be installed</em>)
  <br />
  This .exe patch allows creatures affected by Sleep to awaken if hit, and creatures affected by Greater Command to make a save each round to awaken. I'd prefer that this be included in the main component, but being that it is an .exe patch, it may give problems due to different localizations, patches, no-CD cracks, etc. Unnecessary and not installable for Enhanced Edition games.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Spell Deflection blocks AoE spells</strong> (<em>may be used with or without the main component</em>)
  <br />
  AoE spells like Fireball and Horrid Wilting pierce through Spell Deflection spells due to the spell deflection effect not knowing how to handle AoE projectiles. Using this patch, that no longer will that be the case, and AoE spells will be deflected and take up charges like normal single target spells. The exception to this rule are "stationary" spells like Cloudkill and Ice Storm that trigger multiple times over a duration - due to game engine limitations, these spells would continually drain Spell Deflection charges with every pulse they affect a character. Rather than let that happen, these stills simply are still able to pierce Spell Deflection.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>Update Spellbooks of Joinable NPCs</strong> (<em>requires the main component be installed</em>)
  <br />
  The main component disables, moves around, and/or changes the spell schools of some spells, and some joinable NPCs have leftover versions of these spells. This component updates them so that those deprecated versions of spells will not be found in their spellbooks.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Revised Warrior HLAs</strong> (<em>may be used with or without the main component</em>)
  <br />
  A minor addition that doesn't completely fall within the scope of SR, this component slightly revises a few warrior high level abilities. Hardiness is changed from 40% resistance to all damage to 25%, while Whirlwind Attack and Greater Whirlwind Attack are changed from 10 attacks per round for 1 round to simply twice as many attacks per round for 2 rounds.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Optional settings.ini Tweaks</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  In [game directory]/spell_rev/, there is a "settings.ini" file that you can open and modify with a plaintext editor (e.g. Notepad) to change certain characteristics of Spell Revisions <strong>before</strong> installing the main component of Spell Revisions.
  </p>
  </p>
  <strong>install_tobex</strong> (default 1)
  <br />
  When set to 1, ToBEx will be installed on non-EE games (if not already installed - ToBEx is required for non-EE games for SR to fully function).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>revised_saves</strong> (default 1)
  <br />
  When set to 1, revised saving throws for all characters will be installed. These revised tables are an attempt to be more sensible and better balanced between the classes, but they do somewhat deviate from the official 2E AD&D saving throws tables.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>celestials</strong> (default 1)
  <br />
  When set to 1, SR will install its revised celestials (Devas and Planetars).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>fiends</strong> (default 1)
  <br />
  When set to 1, SR will install its revised fiends (Death Knight, Glabrezu, Pit Fiend).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>dispel_globes</strong> (default 1)
  <br />
  When set to 1, globes of invulnerability cannot be taken down by dispelling effects (e.g. Dispel/Remove Magic, Carsomyr, etc.), but the globe will not protect the rest of their spells from being protected (vanilla BG2 behavior). When set to 0, the globe can be taken down as well (vanilla BG1 behavior). When set to 2, the globe cannot be dispelled and <strong>will</strong> protect all other effects on the protected creature from being dispelled as well. With any setting, globes will still be taken down with normal anti-magic (e.g. Secret Word, Ruby Ray of Reversal, etc.).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>petrification</strong> (default 1)
  <br />
  When set to 1, all creatures will be in a permanent "held" status when petrified instead of the old stone status (avoids potentially game-breaking bugs). When set to 0, the vanilla style of petrification will be used instead. When set to 2, only enemies will be petrified in the stone style; party members will instead be permanently held.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>friendly_spells_pierce </strong> (default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, all friendly spells may pierce through spell protection spells (e.g. Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Trap, etc.). This allows you to use e.g. healing spells without worrying about your Spell Deflection wasting charges to absorb it (this is the opposite of vanilla behavior, where e.g. Cure Light Wounds would be absorbed by Globe of Invulnerability).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>anti_magic_spells_pierce </strong> (default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, all anti-magic spells will always pierce through (i.e. be able to target creatures with) the improved invisibility status regardless of Detect Invisibility/True Seeing status. This applies to Spell Thrust, Secret Word, Pierce Magic, Ruby Ray of Reversal, Khelben's Warding Whip, Pierce Shield, and Spellstrike. When set to 2, Breach is also included.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>spell_protections </strong> (default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, all spell protections (e.g. Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archon et al.) will protect against Dispel and Remove Magic as if they were any other 3rd level spell.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>spellbook_hlas </strong> (default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, all arcane and divine HLAs will remain in spellbooks and take up spell slots to memorize and use. When set to 0, all arcane and divine HLAs will no longer be spells that you can find in spellbooks but instead become innate abilities that can be used independently of normal spell memorization - however, they may only be taken and memorized once.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>targetable_chant </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, Chant can be directed at any point from within sight instead of automatically self-targeting (vanilla behavior). Currently unknown how this behaves with the AI attempting to use this spell.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>blindness </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, the arcane spell Blindness is restored to the slot that Obscuring Mist currently occupies (but remains in druids' spellbooks).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>pick_familiar </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, the Find Familiar spell allows you to choose the type of familiar you wish to have (note that EET games cannot benefit from this, as EET changes how this spell works too much in order to have the spell work properly across its different campaigns).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>slowing_web </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, Web no longer holds characters but instead makes it so characters cannot attack or cast spells, are slowed down to 1/8th movement speed, and suffer a -4 penalty to AC.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>alternative_dispel_magic </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, Dispel Magic (arcane, divine, Inquisitor's, and Yeslick's) no longer uses the caster level vs. target level mechanics as per vanilla, but instead a simple saving throw that scales with level (-1 for every 5 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -4 at 20th level). When set to 0, the vanilla dispelling mechanics are used. When set to 2, Dispel Magic becomes a sort of lesser Breach AoE effect - one combat and one specific protection are removed from each creature, growing to two of each at 10th level, then three of each at 15th level.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>alternative_remove_magic </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  Identical to the component above, but instead applies to the Remove Magic.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>chaos </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, the arcane spell Chaos is restored to the slot that Waves of Fatigue currently occupies.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>aoe_lower_resistance </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, Lower Resistance becomes a 20' radius AoE effect (makes it more feasible for use against e.g. groups of drow).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>spell_immunity </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  Non-fuctional at this time, do not change.
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>resist_imprisonment </strong>(default 0)
  <br />
  When set to 1, Imprisonment allows for a vs. spell saving throw at a -6 penalty (note that it is still not subject to magic resistance even when this is enabled).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>ee_two_handed_shapeshifts </strong>(default 1, EE-only)
  <br />
  When set to 1, off-hand attacks/shields are disabled for shapeshifted/polymorphed characters (bug/exploit fix).
  <p>
  </p>
  <strong>ee_enchanted_weapon </strong>(default 0, EE-only)
  <br />
  When set to 1, the 4th level arcane spell Enchanted Weapon simply sets your current weapon to have an enchantment bonus of +3 instead of allowing you to create an entirely new weapon.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Spell Revisions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  <strong>Spell Description Changes</strong>
  <br />
  Descriptions for all spells have been updated. Now, you can be sure that what you read is what you get (well, maybe 95% sure). Descriptions are constructed in the following manner:
  </p>
  <pre>&lt;Name&gt;
&lt;Level&gt;
&lt;School&gt;
&lt;Sphere&gt;
  Listed only in divine spells
&lt;Range&gt;
  Personal - area of effect is centered on the caster
  Touch    - same as the range of one-handed weapons
  Short    - 1/3 the visual range of the caster
  Medium   - 2/3 the visual range of the caster
  Long     - visual range of the caster, the longest that the game allows
&lt;Duration&gt;
  BG2 uses the following units:
  1 round => 6 seconds
  1 turn  = 10 rounds
  1 hour  = 5 turns
&lt;Casting Time&gt;
  1 = fastest
  9 = 1 round = slowest
&lt;Area of Effect&gt;
  Caster     - spell affects the caster only
  1 creature - spell affects any one creature
  X' radius  - spell affects creatures in the given radius (50 feet is almost equal to visual range of caster)
  Cone       - spell has a cone-shaped area of effect
&lt;Saving Throw&gt;
  X Half    - making a successful save vs. X reduces damage by half
  X Partial - making a successful save vs. X results in a reduced effect
  X Negates - making a successful save vs. X results in no effect
  None      - there is no saving throw against this spell
  Special   - the spell has multiple saving throws, different targets roll different saving throws, etc.
&lt;Description&gt;</pre>
  <p>
  <strong>Universal School of Magic</strong>
  <br />
  Spells that belong to the universal school can be learned and cast by every specialist mage. Universal spells include Find Familiar, all contingency spells, all sequencer and trigger spells, and Wish spells.
  </p>
  <p>
  <a id="spell_changes"></a><strong>Overview of Spell Changes</strong>

  Complete spell descriptions of modified and new spells are available: <a href="readme-arcane_spells.html">arcane</a> and <a href="readme-divine_spells.html">divine</a>. Note that if you're looking for a spell that's not listed here, then it has probably been renamed or possibly replaced by another.

  <p>
  <strong>How to Exclude Certain Spells from Being Installed</strong>
  <br />
  Note: this must be done before installing the mod. To disable a certain spell, open the file <strong>spell_rev/setup-spell_rev.tp2</strong> with a text editor, search for the spell in question, and comment out it and its related files /* like so */. Anything inside the commented area will get skipped when installing. Here is an example for Oracle.
  </p>
  <p>
  In spell_rev\components\main_component.tpa, searching for 'Oracle' yields:
  </p>
  <pre>
COPY ~spell_rev\spwi5##\spwi515.spl~     ~override~  // Oracle
  SAY NAME1 @639    SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC @640
COPY ~spell_rev\spwi5##\scrl6w.itm~     ~override~
  SAY NAME2 @639    SAY IDENTIFIED_DESC   @640
  </pre>
  <p>
  Adding the following will prevent the spell from being installed:
  </p>
  <pre>
<span class="red">/* </span>COPY ~spell_rev\spwi5##\spwi515.spl~     ~override~  // Oracle
  SAY NAME1 @639    SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC @640
COPY ~spell_rev\spwi5##\scrl6w.itm~     ~override~
  SAY NAME2 @639    SAY IDENTIFIED_DESC   @640<span class="red"> */</span>
  </pre>
  <p>
  Hooray, Oracle will no longer be changed when you install the mod! If you have any questions or require assistance with any of the above, feel free to drop me a line in the <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=153">forum</a>.

<h2>Thanks and Acknowledgements</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  Firstly, many thanks to Gibberlings Three, and especially Cam, for hosting!
  </p>
  <p>
  Huge thanks of course to Westley Weimer, who created an astonishingly flexible and powerful mod editor for IE games, and to the bigg for his modifications to that editor. Many thanks also to the creators of the Infinity Engine Structure Description Project, which clarified what the hell was going on several dozen times; and to Jon Hauglid, for Near Infinity.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm also very grateful to anyone who has beta tested the mod and/or provided much useful feedback, especially to Mike1072 and Ardanis, whose help has been essential to this project. Thanks to those who have contributed, each in his/her own way, like Galactygon (who made possible to apply a few tweaks), and Yarpen and Scorpio (for working on BAMs), but also many others. A special thanks goes out to Taimon for providing some wonderful .exe patches, fixing things long thought unfixable. Thanks to those so brave to translate the whole mod: Fess, Silent, Commander L for the Russian translation; Ancalagon el negro for the Spanish one; and Lefreut (of the d'Oghmatiques) for the French one.
  </p>
  <p>
  And last but not least, thanks to Marv for creating ADPack from which all my work started...
