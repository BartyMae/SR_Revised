revised_saves                   = 1 // installs Demi's revised saves tables for all classes (simplified and arguably a little more balanced than vanilla)
celestials                      = 1 // set to 0 if you prefer alternative celestials without SR mucking things up
fiends                          = 1 // set to 0 if you prefer alternative fiends (e.g. atweaks') without SR mucking things up
dispel_globes                   = 1 // set to 0 to make globes of invulnerability not be dispelled by Dispel/Remove Magic
enchanted_weapon                = 1 // set to 0 if you prefer EE's implementation of Enchanted Weapon (no new item, just sets current weapons to +3 enchantment level - EE only)
ai_spell_immunity               = 0 // set to 1 to make the AI be able to use the old Spell Immunity spells
saving_throw_imprisonment       = 0 // set to 1 for Imprisonment to have a -6 saving throw instead of no save
blindness                       = 0 // set to 1 to restore the original mage spell Blindness (replaces Obscuring Mist for mages - druids still have it)
