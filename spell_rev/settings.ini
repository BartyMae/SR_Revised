// Spell Revisions
install_tobex                   = 1 // installs ToBEx; automatically skipped if it's an EE game or if ToBEx is already installed and up to date
revised_saves                   = 1 // installs Demivrgvs's revised saves tables for all classes (simplified and arguably a little more balanced than vanilla)
celestials                      = 1 // set to 0 if you prefer alternative celestials without SR mucking things up
fiends                          = 1 // set to 0 if you prefer alternative fiends without SR mucking things up
dispel_globes                   = 1 // set to 0 to make globes of invulnerability make the caster immune to Dispel/Remove Magic, set to 2 to make it so that the globe itself can also be dispelled in addition to other effects (BG1 behavior)
petrification                   = 1 // set to 0 for all creatures to be petrified a la vanilla (statues, chunked if hit); set to 2 if you only want non-party members to do so (party members will instead get the "nice" hold-style petrification)
cleric_remove_magic             = 1 // set to 0 for clerics to no longer receive access to Remove Magic (Dispel Magic with smaller AoE that targets only enemies) but only Dispel Magic instead
blindness                       = 0 // set to 1 to restore the original mage spell Blindness (replaces arcane Obscuring Mist, druids still have it)
spell_immunity                  = 0 // set to 1 to restore the original mage spell Spell Immunity (note: not yet fully implemented, do not enable)
resist_imprisonment             = 0 // set to 1 for Imprisonment to have a -6 saving throw instead of no save (still not subject to magic resistance)
slowing_web                     = 0 // set to 1 for Web to not hold and instead apply a -4 AC penalty, reduce movement speed to 1/8th, and disable attacking and spellcasting upon a failed saving throw
pick_familiar                   = 0 // set to 1 to be able to pick your familiary type when using Find Familiar (NOTE: SR/R's Find Familiar spell is not installed on EET games at all due to EET radically changing how this spell works)

// Enhanced Editions
ee_enchanted_weapon             = 0 // set to 1 if you prefer EE's implementation of Enchanted Weapon (no new item, just sets current weapons to +3 enchantment level - EE-only for technical reasons)
ee_two_handed_shapeshifts       = 1 // set to 0 if you want shapeshifts to have off-hand attacks/shields enabled (bug/exploit - EE-only for technical reasons)
